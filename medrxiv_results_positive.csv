Lansdorp']",Jur van Berkel (jurvanberkel@eurocept.nl),"['1 Eurocept Clinics , The Netherlands', '2 Hyperbaric Medical Center (HGC) , Rijswijk, The Netherlands', '3 Deptartment of Pulmonary Medicine, Erasmus Medical Center , Rotterdam, The Netherlands']","A potential beneficial effect of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) on complaints of long COVID was found, leading to increased demand for this treatment despite many remaining clinical questions and lack of formal guideline recommendations and reimbursement. A registry was set up in order to gain more insight into patient characteristics and (long-term) outcomes of long COVID patients undergoing HBOT. Patient-reported outcome measures were collected at baseline, after treatment and at 3-month follow up. The primary outcome measures were the mental and physical component score (MCS/PCS) of the SF-36 questionnaire 3 months after HBOT. A clinically relevant positive or negative response was defined as an increase or decrease of [&ge;]10% in MCS and/or PCS after 3 months. Secondary outcomes included the EQ-5D, severity of complaints and ability to work. In this prospective registry of 232 long COVID patients, 65% of long term-ill patients had a clinically relevant increase in quality of life. However, 15% of the patients experienced deterioration in quality of life. Symptoms that showed most improvement were predominantly in the cognitive domain. This indicates that HBOT may have a positive effect on complaints of long COVID, but alertness for worsening of the condition should be exercised."

Antimalarial self-medication is one of the factors associated with antimalarial resistance, and is on the rise globally and has become quite common among developing populations. Self-medication is when individuals choose and use medications to treat symptoms they perceive or diagnose themselves, without the guidance of a healthcare professional. This study aimed at investigating prevalence and determinants of antimalarial drug self-medication among adults in Ndola district, Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among adults in Ndola district, Zambia in June 2023. Using multistage cluster sampling, 446 participants were randomly selected and interviewed through a mobile-based structured questionnaire administered by the researchers using Kobo collect/kobo toolbox. The head of household was the primary participant. Data was then exported to Microsoft Excel, cleaned and coded, and thereafter exported to STATA version 16.1 for analysis. Chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis was used to test associations between categorical variables and to estimate the odds of antimalarial drug self-medication associated with the explanatory variables. The prevalence of antimalarial drug self-medication was 20% in this study population and the factors significantly associated were; moderate to mild illness, bad experience with hospital care, lack of knowledge about antimalarial drug resistance, and the perception that antimalarial drug self-medication was not risky. The finding that antimalarial self-medication was common in this study population is suggestive of a poor state of the health-care delivery system possibly due to inadequate manpower, stock out of drugs in health facilities, and lack of awareness about the risks of self-medication. This further suggests that there is great need for regulatory authorities to strengthen drug regulations and update the list of over-the-counter and essential medicines to ensure the safety of public health. In addition, authorities should repackage malaria sensitization messages to strongly highlight the risks of antimalarial drug self-medication."

However, little is known about the short-term health impacts of socioeconomic exposures during early adulthood. In this study we describe distinct socioeconomic trajectories of early adulthood (age 16-24y), and assess associations of these trajectories with measures of cardiometabolic health at age 24y.  MethodsParticipants of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), with data across age 16y to 24y (2007-2017) were included (n=7,568). Longitudinal latent class analysis identified socioeconomic trajectories, based on education and employment data across ages 16-24y. Cardiometabolic outcomes at age 24y comprised anthropometric, vascular, metabolic and cardiovascular structure and function measures. We modelled differences in cardiometabolic outcomes at age 24y across the socioeconomic trajectory classes, adjusting for childhood socioeconomic position, adolescent health behaviours and adolescent health.  ResultsFour early adulthood socioeconomic trajectories were identified: (1) Higher Education (41% of the population), (2) Extended Education (9%), (3) Part-Time Employment (21%), and (4) Early Employment (29%). Associations between socioeconomic trajectory and cardiometabolic outcomes differed by sex. Among males, the Higher Education and Extended Education classes showed a healthier cardiometabolic profile, and the Part-time Employment class the least healthy. Among females there was less clear distinction between the classes, and the pattern across different outcomes was not consistent.  ConclusionThe newly identified  Part-time Employment class showed the least healthy cardiometabolic profile, and further research should focus on this group to understand the exposures contributing to poor cardiometabolic health in this sector of the population."

We estimated and compared causal estimates of height, body mass index (BMI), type 2 diabetes, age at menarche, age at menopause, breast density, alcohol consumption, regular smoking, and physical activity across these subtypes.  MethodsWe used a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach and selected genetic instrumental variables from large-scale risk factor GWAS. Publicly available summary-level data for the following subtypes were included: luminal A-like; luminal B/HER2-negative-like; luminal B-like; HER2-enriched-like; triple negative. We employed multiple methods to evaluate the strength of causal evidence for each risk factor-subtype association.  ResultsCollectively, our analyses indicated that increased height and decreased BMI are probable causal risk factors for all five subtypes. For the other risk factors, the strength of evidence for causal effects differed across subtypes. Heterogeneity in the magnitude of causal effect estimates for age at menopause and breast density was explained by null findings for triple negative tumours. Regular smoking was the sole risk factor for which there was no evidence for a causal effect on any subtype.  ConclusionsThis study suggests that established breast cancer risk factors differ across hormone receptor subtypes."

Typhi) bacteria invading through the gut lumen. Transmission occurs through ingestion of contaminated food and water, particularly in settings with poor water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure, resulting in over 10 million illnesses annually. It is well established that vaccines and natural infections can stimulate protective immunity against S. Typhi. As the pathogen invades through the gastrointestinal tract, it is plausible that the gut microbiome may also influence the outcome of S. Typhi exposure. There is some evidence that bacteria producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) may create an environment unfavourable to invasive Salmonella, but data from humans is very limited.  To investigate the association between gut microbiome and typhoid fever, we analysed samples collected from three all-age cohorts recruited in a prospective surveillance study conducted in parallel in three settings where typhoid fever is endemic (Dhaka, Bangladesh; Blantyre, Malawi; and Kathmandu, Nepal). Cohorts consisted of acute typhoid fever patients (n=92), asymptomatic household contacts of typhoid fever patients (representing individuals who were likely exposed to S. Typhi but did not develop disease, n=97), and asymptomatic serosurvey participants with high Vi antibody titres (representing individuals who were exposed to S. Typhi and may be carriers, n=69). The stool microbiomes of each cohort were characterised using shotgun metagenomics, and bacterial composition and diversity were compared.  We identified four bacterial species and 28 metabolic gene clusters (MGCs) that were significantly lower in abundance in typhoid fever patients compared with household contacts (i.e. probably exposed), in two of the three host populations (Bangladesh and Malawi). These may represent taxa that provide protection against development of clinical infection upon exposure to S. Typhi, and include the inflammation-associated species Prevotella copri clade A and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and seven MGCs involved in SCFA metabolism. The putative protection provided by SCFA metabolism was supported by data from a controlled human infection model conducted in a UK population, in which participants who did not develop typhoid fever following ingestion of S. Typhi had significantly higher abundance of a putative SCFA-metabolising MGC (q-value = 0.22).  This study identified the same associations between taxonomic and functional microbiota characteristics and non-susceptibility to typhoid fever across multiple cohorts. Future research should explore the potential functional role of SCFAs and inflammation-associated bacteria in resistance to S. Typhi and other enteric infections."

Increasing evidence indicates that a significant proportion of pulmonary TB survivors develop TB-associated respiratory disability, commonly referred to as post-TB lung disease (PLTD) and marked by impaired respiratory function, persistent symptoms, and activity limitations. However, the prevalence, risk factors, and progression of TB-associated respiratory disability throughout the life course are not well understood. To address these gaps, we will undertake a systematic review and individual participant-level data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) focusing on TB-associated respiratory disability in children, adolescents, and adults successfully treated for pulmonary TB.  Methods and analysisWe will systematically search MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Global Index Medicus, and medRxiv for original studies investigating TB-associated respiratory disability in people of all ages who have completed treatment for microbiologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed pulmonary TB. Authors of eligible studies will be invited to contribute de-identified data and form a collaborative group. Primary outcomes will be (1) abnormal lung function based on spirometry parameters and (2) chronic respiratory symptoms. We will estimate the overall and subgroup-specific prevalence of each outcome through IPD meta-analysis. Next, we will develop clinical prediction tools assessing the risk of future TB-associated respiratory disability at (i) the start of TB treatment and (ii) end of TB treatment for those without existing signs of disability. Finally, we will use stepwise hierarchical modelling to identify epidemiological determinants of respiratory disability.

Despite their potential benefits, the development and implementation of malaria EWS face significant challenges and limitations. We reviewed the current evidence on malaria EWS, including their settings, methods, performance, actions, and evaluation.  MethodsWe conducted a comprehensive literature search using keywords related to EWS and malaria in various databases and registers. We included primary research and programmatic reports focused on developing and implementing Malaria EWS. We extracted and synthesized data on the characteristics, outcomes, and experiences of Malaria EWS.  ResultsAfter reviewing 5,535 records, we identified 30 studies from 16 countries that met our inclusion criteria. The studies varied in their transmission settings, from pre-elimination to high burden, and their purposes, ranging from outbreak detection to resource allocation. The studies employed various statistical and machine-learning models to forecast malaria cases, often incorporating environmental covariates such as rainfall and temperature. The most common mode used is the time series model. The performance of the models was assessed using measures such as the Akaike Information Criterion( AIC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and adjusted R squared(R 2). The studies reported actions and responses triggered by EWS predictions, such as vector control, case management, and health education. The lack of standardized criteria and methodologies limited the evaluation of EWS impact.  ConclusionsThis review provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of Malaria EWS, highlighting the progress, challenges, and gaps in the field.

Nigeria introduced the 3-month isoniazid-rifampicin (3HR) shorter regimen TPT for all eligible contacts through the USAID-funded Stop TB Partnership introducing New Tools Project (iNTP). This study assesses the facilitators and barriers to the uptake of the newly introduced child-friendly 3HR TPT for child contacts of TB patients in Nigeria.  This was a cross-sectional descriptive study using mixed methods. In-depth interviews were conducted among 36 purposely selected Healthcare Workers (HCWs) and 36 caregivers of child contacts. Records of TPT-eligible child contacts (0-14 years) from April to September 2022 were retrospectively extracted. Study data were analyzed using appropriate statistical tools for qualitative and quantitative techniques.  There were 7,906 child contacts identified, of which 7,902 (99.9%) contacts were screened for TB, 1,704 (21.5%) were presumptive, 264 (15.5%) diagnosed with TB, and 6,994 were eligible for TB Preventive Therapy. Additionally, out of 6,994 eligible child contacts, 3984 (57%) were initiated on TPT with 2,982 (74,8%) enrolled on 3HR and 1,002 (25%) on 6H. Of the clients placed on 3HR, 2,499 (85%) completed treatment, 309 (10.5%) lost to follow-up, 27(0.92%) developed Tuberculosis while 48 (1.6%) interrupted treatment.  The key drivers of 3HR TPT uptake among child contacts were TPT-related health education and counseling. Access barriers to 3HR TPT elicited included stigma, poverty, transportation cost, stock out, ineffective monitoring and management of side effects issues of 3HR TPT, subpar Government funding and commitment to addressing TPT implementation challenges and inadequate knowledge among HCWs and caregivers.  In conclusion, 3HR-TPT uptake among child contacts of index TB patients was high. Enhanced provider training and intensive community health education should be sustained while identified individual, structural, and institutional barriers should be addressed to improve implementation."

We aimed to quantify the independent and joint impact of influenza A, influenza B, and RSV on IPD risk at the population level.  MethodsWe used a 2:1 self-matched case-crossover study design to evaluate acute effects of respiratory virus activity on IPD risk. This design ensures that effects are not confounded by within-individual characteristics that remain constant over short periods of time. We included 3,892 IPD cases occurring between January 2000 and June 2009. Effects were measured using univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regression. Multivariable models included environmental covariates (e.g., temperature, absolute humidity, and UV index) and interaction terms between viruses.  ResultsInfluenza A activity and influenza B activity were both independently associated with increased IPD risk; however, co-circulation of influenza A and B reduced the impact of both viruses. RSV activity was positively associated with increased IPD risk only in the presence of increased influenza A or influenza B activity.  ConclusionsTo our knowledge this represents the first study to consider the impact of interactions between these viruses on IPD risk in Canada. Our findings suggest that the prevention of IPD should be considered as a potential health benefit of influenza and RSV vaccination programs."

Previous research has identified diabetes as a primary risk factor for congestive heart failure (CHF), a condition where stiffened heart muscles hinder oxygenated blood circulation. Despite its severity, few studies have examined CHF prognosis in diabetic patients. This study aims to provide survival estimates and provide their comparisons among predictors, assess mortality risks based on specific variables, and reveal patient outcome patterns.  MethodsWe analyzed data from a 2015 study at Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and Allied Hospital (FICAH), Pakistan, focusing on 125 diabetic patients with Class III or IV heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Kaplan-Meier estimates provided survival rates, log-rank tests compared survival across variables, Cox regression models estimated hazard ratios, and cluster analysis grouped patients by characteristics and survival rates.  ResultsThe study examined 125 diabetic heart failure patients. Of these, 40(32%) were censored and the remaining 85(68%) died. The total follow-up period was 278 days, on the 120th day, 0.752[95% CI = 0.678,0,883] of the patients survived after initial diagnosis. Log-rank tests showed survival differences linked to high blood pressure, anemia and smoking. Cox regression identified age, smoking and hypertension as major mortality risk factors. Cluster analysis revealed the risk factors associated with middle aged and the older patients.  ConclusionThe overall prognosis of heart failure patients with diabetes was poor with high mortality rates, implying effective treatment and management."

The Antibiotics for Children with severe Diarrhoea (ABCD) trial provides an opportunity to leverage the azithromycin treatment response to inform which diarrhoea episodes are bacterial.  MethodsWe analysed data from ABCD, which randomized children with watery diarrhoea to azithromycin or placebo. We quantified heterogeneity in the azithromycin treatment response by the quantity of enteric pathogens detected by qPCR as a tool for understanding aetiology.  ResultsThe heterogeneity in azithromycin treatment response was most prominent for Shigella. The risk ratio for diarrhoea on day 3 post enrolment for azithromycin compared to placebo was 13% (95% CI:3, 23) lower per log10 increase in Shigella quantity. The protective effect of azithromycin on diarrhoea at day 3 also became stronger as pathogen quantities increased for Vibrio cholerae, ST-ETEC, and tEPEC. No association between pathogen quantity and azithromycin response was observed for Campylobacter, LT-ETEC or EAEC. The associations were consistent for the outcome of 90-day hospitalisation or death.  ConclusionsThe relationships between response to azithromycin treatment and bacterial pathogen quantities observed for Shigella, Vibrio cholerae, ST-ETEC and tEPEC confirm prior evidence that these pathogens are the likely cause of diarrhoea when detected at high quantities.

Poor sleep health is associated with elevated inflammation (including elevated blood CRP levels) which may explain associations of sleep insufficiency with metabolic, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. Our study aims to characterize the relationships among sleep health phenotypes and CRP markers --blood, genetic, and epigenetic indicators-- within the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL).  MethodsIn HCHS/SOL, methylation risk scores (MRS)-CRP and polygenetic risk score (PRS)-CRP were constructed separately as weighted sums of methylation beta values or allele counts, respectively, for each individual. Sleep health phenotypes were measured using self-reported questionnaires and objective measurements. Survey-weighted linear regression established the association between the multiple sleep phenotypes (obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), sleep duration, insomnia and excessive sleepiness symptom), cognitive assessments, diabetes and hypertension with CRP markers while adjusting for age, sex, BMI, study center, and the first five principal components of genetic ancestry in HCHS/SOL.  ResultsWe included 2221 HCHS/SOL participants (age range 37-76 yrs, 65.7% female) in the analysis. Both the MRS-CRP (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-0.42, p = 3.3 x 10-38) and the PRS-CRP (95% CI: 0.15-0.25, p = 1 x 10-14) were associated with blood CRP level. Moreover, MRS-CRP was associated with sleep health phenotypes (OSA, long sleep duration) and related conditions (diabetes and hypertension), while PRS-CRP markers were not associated with these traits. Circulating CRP level was associated with sleep duration and diabetes. Associations between OSA traits and metabolic comorbidities weakened after adjusting for MRS-CRP, most strongly for diabetes, and least for hypertension.  ConclusionsMRS-CRP is a promising estimate for systemic and chronic inflammation as reflected by circulating CRP levels, which either mediates or serves as a common cause of the association between sleep phenotypes and related comorbidities, especially in the presence of diabetes."

Cox regression analysis was used to calculate the risk ratio of reported adverse events (AEs) that affected recovery after seasonal influenza vaccination. Most AEs were nonserious and occurred within 48 hours. The most common AEs were general disorders and administration site conditions (therapeutic and non-therapeutic responses, inflammation) and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (musculoskeletal and connective tissue pain and discomfort, bursal disorders, joint-related signs, and symptoms).

We characterized COVID-19-attributable costs from the health system perspective.  MethodsPopulation-based matched cohort study in Ontario, Canada, using health administrative data. To assign attribution to COVID-19, individuals, defined as exposed (positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test, 01/2020-12/2020) were matched 1:1 to an unexposed individuals (01/2016-12/2018). Historical matching was used to reduce biases due to overall reductions in healthcare during the pandemic and contamination bias. The index date was defined as the first occurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. We used phase-of-care costing to calculate mean attributable per-person costs (2023 CAD), standardized to 10 days, during four phases of illness: pre-index date, acute care, post-acute care (suggestive of PCC), and terminal phase (stratified by early and late deaths). Finally, we estimated total costs at 360 days by combining costs with survival estimates.  ResultsOf 165,838 exposed individuals, 159,817 were matched (mean age 40{+/-}20 years, 51% female). Mean (95%CI) attributable 10-day costs per person were $1 ($-4, $6) pre-index, $240 ($231, $249) during acute care, and $18 ($14, $21) during post-acute phases. During the terminal phase, mean attributable costs were $3,928 ($3,471, $4,384) for early deaths and $1,781 ($1,182, $2,380) for late deaths. Hospitalizations accounted for 42% to 100% of total costs. Compared to males, costs among females were lower during the acute care phase, but higher during the post-acute care phase. Mean cumulative per-person cost at 360 days was $2,553 ($2,348, $2,756); females had lower costs ($2,194 [$1,945, $2,446]) than males ($2,921 [$2,602, $3,241]).

Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) reduces the pathology of SCD and several mutations lead to the prolonged production of HbF into childhood and adult life. HbF has been suggested to contribute to protection against malaria. Two long-term cohorts were genotyped for three quantitative trait loci associated with HbF production and analyzed for HbF titers, malaria clinical episodes and the production of parasite stages infectious to mosquitoes, gametocytes in asymptomatic infections. Plasmodium falciparum parasites were also grown in vitro in HbSS cells with measured levels of HbF. The genetic determinants of prolonged HbF production were associated with increased HbF titers and that increased HbF afforded protection from malaria disease but increased the production of gametocytes. The presence of HbF in sickled red cells was also shown in in vitro culture to enable parasite persistence in conditions otherwise deleterious for the parasite and enabled complete maturation of gametocytes. The beneficial personal effect of HbF, whether through protection against malaria or alleviating effects of SCD, is offset by increased parasite transmissibility and disease burden for the community. These individuals represent an important reservoir of infection and need to be targeted in elimination strategies.

We assessed immune responses in n=42 health-care workers (median age 47 years, interquartile range, IQR 19{middle dot}5 years, 48% male), who in August 2024 were vaccinated with 30 g of the updated mRNA omicron JN.1 vaccine (bretovameran, BioNTech/Pfizer, Mainz, Germany). Humoral immune responses were analyzed directly prior to and 13 days after vaccination.  The omicron JN.1 vaccination resulted in a significant 1{middle dot}2-fold increase of anti-S IgG and 1{middle dot}2-fold increase of omicron anti-S IgG (p<0{middle dot}0001). To assess plasma neutralisation capacity, we employed a pseudovirus particle (pp) neutralisation assay including S proteins of seven SARS-CoV-2 lineages. Baseline response rates were 100% for XBB.1.5pp, 90% for JN.1pp and KP.2pp, 82% for KP.2.3pp, 92% for KP.3pp, and 72% for LB.1pp. Before JN.1 vaccination, particles bearing KP sublineage S proteins were slightly less efficiently neutralised compared with JN.1pp (median change, 1{middle dot}2-fold to 2{middle dot}6-fold), while LB.1pp neutralisation was 3-fold reduced, indicating antibody evasion. After vaccination, the response rates increased significantly for all pseudoviruses except XBB.1.5pp and KP.3pp. Thus, we observed a significant increase in neutralisation of JN.1pp, KP.2pp, KP.2.3pp, and LB.1pp, showing a median change of 2.2-fold, 3.8-fold, 3.3-fold, and 4.9-fold, respectively.  In summary, bretovameran increased anti-S IgG and strengthened neutralising responses against circulating SARS-CoV-2-variants, except for KP.3. We wish to point out that our study population exhibited high pre-vaccination omicron-related hybrid immunity and may not be representative of other populations. Our data supports the notion that the new mRNA vaccine against omicron JN.1 most likely increases protection against hospitalization and post-COVID sequelae caused by most current variants."

Treatments for TBM include conventional therapy alone as well as adjunctive use of steroidal therapy.  MethodsA comprehensive search of electronic databases such as PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus was conducted from inception to April 2024 to retrieve all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared steroidal therapy plus conventional antituberculosis therapy with antituberculosis therapy alone for patients of TBM. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.4. Dichotomous outcomes were compared using risk ratio (RR).  ResultsThere was a statistically significant decrease in risk of mortality in the Steroid group compared to the control group (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.75, 0.94; p-value < 0.05). However, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk of neurological deficit between the two groups. There was a statistically significant reduction in the risk of adverse events in the steroidal therapy group compared to the control group (RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.83, 0.98; p-value = 0.03).

This article focuses on the use of fractional optimal control theory to prevent the spread of Buruli ulcers via integrated public health interventions. We formulated a mathematical model using the Atangana-Baleanu-Caputo fractional order derivative operator. We investigated the models existence and uniqueness and presented numerical simulations using the predict-evaluate-correct-evaluate (PECE) method of Adam-Bashforth Moulton. We also study the fractional optimal control problem (FOCP) to minimize the spread of the disease in the endemic regions. We employ the Fractional Pontryagins Maximum Principle (FPMP) and implement the forward-backward method to determine the extremals of the problem. Four control strategies were implemented: promoting health education on the use of protective clothing, enhancing vaccination rates, improving treatment protocols for infected individuals, and spraying insecticides to reduce water-bug populations. After examining the optimal control dynamics of the Buruli ulcer transmission model via multiple simulations with and without control, we discover that there is a substantial decrease in the population of infected humans and the water-bug population. Hence we conclude that the best strategy to implement is by applying all the control strategies suggested."

MR relies on a set of assumptions to obtain unbiased effect estimates, one of these assumptions is that there is no pathway from the genetic variants to the outcome that does not act through the exposure. Increasing genome-wide association study (GWAS) sample sizes for the exposure enables discovery of instrumental variables with smaller effect sizes. We illustrate through simulations how smaller effect sizes could arise from genetic variants that act through traits that have greater liability to confound an exposure-outcome relationship. When such genetic variants are selected as instruments this can bias the MR effect estimate obtained from that instrument in the same direction as the confounded observational association but with larger magnitude. Through simulation we illustrate how the total bias of the MR estimates increases across a range of standard MR estimation methods increases as the proportion of the genetic instruments that are associated with the confounder increases. However, if such heritable confounders are known and can be instrumented, the confounder free effect estimate can be obtained through applying a pre-estimation filtering to standard MR methods, removing instruments that explain more variation in that confounder than the exposure, or by estimating effects through multivariable MR. We highlight the potential for SNPs identified in GWAS to be associated with potential confounders through examination of a recent GWAS of C-Reactive Protein. Finally, we illustrate our approach through estimation of the causal effect of age at menarche on type 2 diabetes, hypothesising that the MR effect estimate may be biased by confounding due to the inclusion of genetic variants associated with early life adiposity as instruments."

Data cleaning or wear time validation can impact outcomes of interest, particularly in young children who spend less time awake. However, no study has systematically compared wear time validation strategies in toddlers. As such, the objective of this study is to compare different fully-automated methods of distinguishing wear and non-wear time (counts and raw data algorithms) to the semi-automated (counts with logbooks) criterion method in toddlers.  MethodsWe recruited 109 toddlers (age 12-35 mos) as part of the iPLAY study to wear an ActiGraph w-GT3X-BT accelerometer on the right hip for [~]7 consecutive days (removed for sleep and water activities). Parents completed a logbook to indicate monitor removal and nap times. We tested 15 nonwear detection methods grouped into 4 main categories: semi-automated logbook, consecutive 0 counts, modified consecutive 0 counts (Troiano and Choi), and raw data methods (van Hees and Ahmadi). Using logbooks as the criterion standard (all wear and wake-time only wear), we calculated the accuracy and F1 scores and compared overall wear time with a two one-sided test of equivalence.  ResultsParticipant daily wear time ranged from 556 to 684 minutes/day depending on method. Accuracy and F1 score ranged from 86 to 95%. Five methods were considered equivalent to the AllWear nonwear criterion (true wear time including sleep-time wear), with only one equivalent to the AwakeWear criterion. Mean absolute differences were lower for the AllWear criterion but ranged 49 to 192 minutes/day  ConclusionsThe 5min0count, 10min_0count, 30min_0count, Troiano60s, and Ahmadi methods provide high accuracy and equivalency when compared to semi-automated cleaning using logbooks. This paper provides insights and quantitative results that can help researchers decide which method may be most appropriate given their population of interest, sample size, and study protocol."

Real-world studies of AEs after COVID-19 suggest that diagnoses of AEs and COVID-19 frequently occur on the same day and may be a source of bias.  MethodsCohort and self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) designs were used in 2 US administrative claims data sources--Merative MarketScan(R) (ages 18-64 years) and Medicare (ages [&ge;] 65 years). AEs included stroke (nonhemorrhagic and hemorrhagic), acute myocardial infarction, myocarditis/pericarditis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism (PE), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), unusual-site and common-site thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome, and appendicitis. In cohort analyses, weighted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) compared adults with a COVID-19 diagnosis and matched comparators. In SCRI analysis, relative incidences (RIs) and 95% CIs compared risk and reference windows within individuals. Analyses were performed starting follow-up on Time 0 and Day 1.  ResultsFor cardiovascular AEs, all estimates starting follow-up on Day 1 were above 1.0 in both data sources. For cohort analyses, the strongest associations were for inpatient PE in both databases: MarketScan, HR=8.65 (95% CI, 6.06-12.35), Medicare HR=3.06 (95% CI, 2.88-3.26). For SCRI analyses, the strongest association in MarketScan was for DIC: RI=32.28 (95% CI, 17.06-61.09) and in Medicare was for myocarditis/pericarditis: RI=4.53 (95% CI, 3.89-5.27). AEs diagnosed concurrently with COVID-19 (ie, on Time 0) were common; including Time 0 in follow-up/risk windows resulted in higher RIs, as well as higher HRs for some AEs. However, some AEs (eg, stroke) were more common on Time 0 in the comparator group resulting in lower HRs.  ConclusionCOVID-19 diagnoses had moderate to strong associations with cardiovascular AEs and weak or inconsistent associations with appendicitis, although estimates varied by design and methodology."

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality; secondary outcomes were duration of hospitalisation and (among participants not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline) the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death. Recruitment closed on 31 March 2024 when funding for the trial ended. The RECOVERY trial is registered with ISRCTN (50189673) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04381936).  FindingsBetween 25 May 2021 and 9 January 2024, 477 COVID-19 patients receiving ventilatory support were randomly allocated to receive usual care plus higher dose corticosteroids versus usual care alone (of whom 99% received corticosteroids during the follow-up period). Of those randomised, 221 (46%) were in Asia, 245 (51%) in the UK and 11 (2%) in Africa. 143 (30%) had diabetes mellitus. Overall, 86 (35%) of 246 patients allocated to higher dose corticosteroids versus 86 (37%) of 231 patients allocated to usual care died within 28 days (rate ratio [RR] 0.87; 95% CI 0.64-1.18; p=0.37). There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients discharged from hospital alive within 28 days (128 [52%] in the higher dose corticosteroids group vs 120 [52%] in the usual care group; RR 1.04, 0.81-1.33]; p=0.78). Among those not on invasive mechanical ventilation at baseline, there was no significant difference in the proportion meeting the composite endpoint of invasive mechanical ventilation or death (76 [37%] of 206 vs 93 [45%] of 205; RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.63-1.00]; p=0.05).  InterpretationIn patients hospitalised for COVID-19 receiving ventilatory support, we found no evidence that higher dose corticosteroids reduced the risk of death compared to usual care, which included low dose corticosteroids.

While the pathobiology of long COVID is still evolving, persistent inflammation has emerged as an important feature of this condition. However, it is unclear if immune responses from COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 re-infection exacerbate or mirror the initial inflammatory responses. To address this question, we quantified 182 inflammatory and neurology-related proteins in plasma using multiplexed affinity proteomics. Plasma samples were collected 6-9 months after first infection, but before COVID-19 vaccination from individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 (n=21) or from individuals with long COVID (n=12). This was benchmarked against plasma from unvaccinated, SARS-CoV-2 naive individuals (n=24). In addition to this cross-sectional analysis, we performed longitudinal analysis in a subset of individuals (n=34), where paired samples collected 2-4 weeks after a third COVID-19 vaccine dose and after SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection were available. Boruta feature selection and lasso regression models identified a distinct plasma profile in long COVID individuals, characterised by elevated IL-20, HAGH, NAAA, CLEC10A, LXN, and MCP-1 and reduced TRAIL, G-CSF, NBL1, and CCL23 protein concentrations. Notably, longitudinal analysis demonstrated that neither COVID-19 booster vaccination nor breakthrough infection replicated inflammatory and neurology-related plasma protein profiles observed after primary infection suggesting an altered immune response outcome in individuals with long COVID upon re-exposure."

MethodsWe analyzed the seroprevalence for CHIKV and ONNV in 470 non-febrile subjects from three regions in Senegal (Sindia, 2018; Thies, 2018; and Kedougou, 2022/2023) using retrospective samples. We assessed the presence of anti-CHIKV IgG and neutralizing titers against CHIKV and ONNV via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and microneutralization tests, respectively, and determined risk factors of CHIKV and ONNV exposure by binary logistic regression.  ResultsThe overall seroprevalence of anti-CHIKV IgG was 24.89% (117/470). Regional seroprevalences were 14.89% (14/94) in Sindia, 28.72% (27/94) in Thies, and 26.95% (76/282) in Kedougou. Among CHIKV IgG-positive samples, 29.91% (35/117) and 39.32% (46/117) had neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV and ONNV, respectively. Of the remaining samples, 20.51% (24/117) were equivocal and 10.26% (12/117) were negative. Multivariate analysis showed that residence in Thies significantly increased the likelihood of CHIKV infection (OR, 3.878; 95% CI: 0.783-19.205), whereas prior malaria infection reduced it (aOR, 0.121; 95% CI: 0.049-0.300).

This study presents a retrospective evaluation of CHIKV and ONNV seroprevalence among non-febrile subjects from three regions in Senegal: Sindia, Thies, and Kedougou. Our analysis revealed regional variation in alphavirus seroprevalence, with 29.91% of subjects exhibiting neutralizing antibodies against CHIKV and 39.32% against ONNV. We identified that residence in Thies was a risk factor for CHIKV, while residence in Kedougou, a history of malaria, and older age were risk factors for ONNV. These findings suggest significant exposure to CHIKV and ONNV across Senegal, underscoring the importance of ongoing surveillance and alphavirus testing among the population."

An epigenetic clock is a predictive tool that measures biological age based on DNAm levels. It can provide insights into an individuals biological age, which may differ from their chronological age. This difference, known as the epigenetic age acceleration, may indicate the state of ones health and risk for age-related diseases. Moreover, epigenetic clocks are used in studies of aging to assess the effectiveness of anti-aging interventions and to understand the underlying mechanisms of aging and disease. Various epigenetic clocks have been developed using samples from different populations, tissues, and cell types, typically by training high-dimensional linear regression models with an elastic net penalty. While these models can predict mean biological age with high precision, there is a lack of uncertainty quantification which is important for interpreting the precision of age estimations and for clinical decision-making. To understand the distribution of a biological age clock beyond its mean, we propose a general pipeline for training epigenetic clocks, based on an integration of high-dimensional quantile regression and conformal prediction, to effectively reveal population heterogeneity and construct prediction intervals. Our approach produces adaptive prediction intervals not only achieving nominal coverage but also accounting for the inherent variability across individuals. By using the data collected from 728 blood samples in 11 DNAm datasets from children, we find that our quantile regression-based prediction intervals are narrower than those derived from conventional mean regression-based epigenetic clocks. This observation demonstrates an improved statistical efficiency over the existing pipeline for training epigenetic clocks. In addition, the resulting intervals have a synchronized varying pattern to age acceleration, effectively revealing cellular evolutionary heterogeneity in age patterns in different developmental stages during individual childhoods and adolescent cohort. Our findings suggest that conformalized high-dimensional quantile regression can produce valid prediction intervals and uncover underlying population heterogeneity. Although our methodology focuses on the distribution of aging in children, it is applicable to a broader range of populations to improve understanding of epigenetic age beyond the mean. This inference-based toolbox could provide valuable insights for future applications of epigenetic interventions for age-related diseases."

In addition, individual European countries developed their own risk classifications for severe COVID-19 to select individuals recommended for annual COVID-19 vaccination. We assessed the discordance between the European and respective national medical risk classifications in assigning children and adults to risk groups for developing severe COVID-19 in populations of the Netherlands and Norway.  MethodsThis multi-country, healthcare data-linkage study covered 17.4 million inhabitants of the Netherlands and 5.6 million inhabitants of Norway by 1 January 2020. Medical conditions were defined based on ICD-10 hospital discharge codes in the European and Dutch classifications, and on ICD-10 and ICPC-2 primary care codes in the Norwegian classification. Subjects were classified as high-, moderate-, or low-risk. Discordance was calculated as the proportion of the population with a different risk status in the respective national compared to the European classification.  FindingsThe overall discordance between European and national risk classification was 12.0% in the Dutch and 13.8% in the Norwegian population. The European classification assigns more individuals to high-risk (9.0% and 9.2% of the Dutch and Norwegian populations, respectively) than the national classifications (1.5% and 3.0%, respectively). National classifications define more individuals as moderate-risk (11.3% and 12.7%, respectively) than the European classification (1.0% and 1.3%, respectively). Classification discordances most frequently involved subjects with cardiovascular disease, lung disease, and diabetes mellitus.  InterpretationThe European classification defines a substantially larger percentage of the population as high-risk for severe COVID-19 than the national classifications. This may have implications for post-pandemic vaccination programs. Further research should assess to what extent the medical conditions responsible for the classification discordances determine the risk of developing severe COVID-19.

This search identified 64 studies, but none of them assessed the impact of different medical risk classifications for severe COVID-19 or compared them across countries or to the European classification.  Added value of this studyTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compared the impact of European and national medical risk classifications for severe COVID-19 by assigning the populations of the Netherlands and Norway to medical risk groups using national healthcare registries. We demonstrated important discrepancies between the European and respective national schemes in classifying high- and moderate-risk individuals in both countries. The chronic conditions responsible for the classification discordances were lung disease, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus, cancer, and hypertension.  Implications of all the available evidenceOur comparative analysis suggests that the choice between the European and national classifications may have important consequences for public health interventions such as vaccination campaigns. The variability in risk assignment based on chronic medical conditions underscores the absence of an international uniform approach. More research is needed to determine the extent to which each chronic medical condition impacts COVID-19 severity in the post-pandemic period, facilitating the refinement of risk classifications and supporting targeted public health interventions."

In microgravity environment, such as the International Space Station (ISS), this mode of transmission requires heightened vigilance and preventive measures due to the prolonged suspension of virus-laden particles, which increases the risk of infection. Using the COVID Airborne Risk Assessment (CARA) tool, we assess the risk of airborne transmission of respiratory viruses in microgravity by simulating the emission, dispersion, and inhalation of virus-laden particles. Our findings show that the unique conditions of microgravity allow these particles to remain airborne for significantly longer periods compared to Earth, leading to a 286-fold increase in virus concentration in the air, resulting in nearly twice the probability of infection for a susceptible host. We also evaluated the effectiveness of preventive measures, and found that facemasks can reduce the risk by up to 23% while continuous HEPA filtration at five air changes per hour proves crucial for managing air quality and minimizing infection risks by reducing airborne virus concentration at 99.79%. However, when simulated the infection risk by accounting the spaceflight-induced immune suppression, we found that the infection probability increased by 12% in the condition that viral load in infected host increase for 8-fold and absence of protective measures. Although facemasks and air filtration help mitigate the risk, their effectiveness diminishes when the viral load carrying by host is high. Enhancing host immunity through vaccination or other interventions is vital, potentially reducing infection probability by up to 14.17% when combined with HEPA filtration. These findings highlight the need for robust mitigation strategies to safeguard the health of astronauts against airborne pathogens during future space missions."

Loon Lens, an autonomous, agentic AI platform, streamlines TiAb screening without the need for human reviewers to conduct any screening.  MethodsThis study validates Loon Lens against human reviewer decisions across eight SLRs conducted by Canadas Drug Agency, covering a range of drugs and eligibility criteria. A total of 3,796 citations were retrieved, with human reviewers identifying 287 (7.6%) for inclusion. Loon Lens autonomously screened the same citations based on the provided inclusion and exclusion criteria. Metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Bootstrapping was applied to compute 95% confidence intervals.  ResultsLoon Lens achieved an accuracy of 95.5% (95% CI: 94.8-96.1), with recall at 98.95% (95% CI: 97.57-100%) and specificity at 95.24% (95% CI: 94.54-95.89%). Precision was lower at 62.97% (95% CI: 58.39-67.27%), suggesting that Loon Lens included more citations for full-text screening compared to human reviewers. The F1 score was 0.770 (95% CI: 0.734-0.802), indicating a strong balance between precision and recall.  ConclusionLoon Lens demonstrates the ability to autonomously conduct TiAb screening with a substantial potential for reducing the time and cost associated with manual or semi-autonomous TiAb screening in SLRs.

Gly2019Ser-related PD (LRRK2-PD) and idiopathic PD (iPD).  BackgroundThere is increasing evidence that the environment impacts disease severity. Recent studies have shown that pesticide exposure is associated with a faster disease progression. However, the relationship between smoking, caffeine, and disease severity has not yet been investigated longitudinally.  MethodsIn this longitudinal study, we included patients with iPD from the PPMI Online (N=2815) and Fox Insight (N=2319) cohorts, as well as patients with LRRK2-PD (N=81) from Fox Insight. Motor signs were assessed with the MDS-UPDRS Part II, and patients were assessed multiple times, followed up to 35 months or 60 months in the PPMI Online or Fox Insight cohort, respectively. The motor sign severity over time was analyzed by applying a linear mixed effects model. The outcome was the cumulative score of the MDS-UPDRS Part II questionnaire. Subsequently, we investigated the association between environmental exposure, lifestyle factors and motor signs. Pesticide exposure in a work setting, smoking, coffee, black tea, green tea, and caffeinated soda consumption were assessed using the validated PD-RFQ-U questionnaires. The mixed effects model included the environmental and lifestyle factors as binary (yes/no) variables.  ResultsWhen comparing LRRK2-related PD and iPD, motor signs were less severe in patients with LRRK2-PD compared to iPD ({beta}=-0.23, p=0.005). In LRRK2-PD, black tea consumption was associated with less severe motor signs ({beta}=-0.51, p=0.028). In patients with iPD, we observed that pesticide exposure was associated with more severe motor signs over time in PPMI-Online ({beta}=0.23, p=3.56x10-9). Smoking was associated with a higher motor signs score in PPMI-Online ({beta}=0.13, p=0.001). Lastly, caffeinated soda was associated with more severe motor signs in patients with iPD from PPMI-Online ({beta}=0.15, p=3.84x10-8) and Fox Insight ({beta}=0.09, p=0.031).  ConclusionsOur results provide further evidence of the importance of environment and lifestyle in PD, even after the disease onset.

MethodsThe original PAFAS parenting scale, which consists of 18 items (parental inconsistency 5 items, coercive parenting 5 items, positive encouragement 3 items, and parent-child relationship 5 items) was applied in two Brazilian birth cohorts in Pelotas (ages 4 [n = 4010] and 6-7 [n = 3867]) and Rio Grande (age 3 [n = 992]). Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, and internal consistency assessed, as well as construct validity in relation to maternal depression measured on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale.  ResultsThe model with a structure of 4 subscales showed that the global scale of parenting on the PAFAS had a good fit, but certain items did not fit well on sub-scales and were removed (2 items from parental inconsistency, 1 from coercive parenting, and 1 from positive encouragement). The original form of the parent-child relationship sub-scale was maintained. Considering the total PAFAS parenting score, we found that mothers with maternal depression had a higher likelihood of more problematic parental practices than mothers without depression.  ConclusionsA revised 14-item PAFAS parenting scale has good psychometric properties and we encourage its use in Brazilian populations."

Here, we employ Generalized Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization and a series of sensitivity analyses to investigate causal links between 70 cortical morphology measures and 199 neuropsychiatric, behavioral, and metabolic phenotypes. We show that total brain cortical surface area (TSA) has significant positive causal effects on 18 phenotypes. The strongest effects include TSA positively influencing cognitive performance, while reverse analyses reveal small effects of cognitive performance on TSA. Global mean cortical thickness (MTH) exhibits significant causal effects on five phenotypes, including schizophrenia. MTH reduces schizophrenia risk and bidirectional causality is found between MTH and smoking initiation. Finally, in regional analyses we detect positive influences of the transverse temporal surface area on cognitive performance and negative influences of transverse temporal thickness on schizophrenia risk. Overall, our results highlight bidirectional associations between TSA, MTH, and neuropsychiatric traits. These insights offer potential avenues for intervention studies aimed at improving brain health."

Research has shown that the polygenic risk score for schizophrenia (PRS-SCZ) is associated with PE. However, the interaction of these exposures and PRS-SCZ remains unknown.  MethodTo systematically investigate gene-environment interaction underlying PE through data-driven agnostic analyses, we conducted 1) a conditional XWAS adjusting for PRS-SCZ to estimate the main effects of the exposures and PRS-SCZ, respectively; 2) exposome-wide interaction studies (XWIS) to estimate multiplicative and additive interactions between PRS-SCZ and exposures; and 3) the correlations between PRS-SCZ and exposures. The study included 148,502 participants from UK biobank.  ResultsIn the conditional XWAS models, the significant effects of PRS-SCZ and 148 exposures on PE remained statistically significant. In the XWIS model, we found a significant multiplicative (Ms, 1.23, 95%CI, 1.10-1.37; P=4.0x10-4) and additive (RERI, 0.55; 95%CI, 0.32-0.77; SI, 0.22; 95%CI, 0.14-0.30; AP, 1.59; 95%CI, 1.30-1.91; all P < 0.05/148) interaction between PRS-SCZ and variable ""serious medical conditions or disability"" on PE. There were six additive gene-environment interactions identified for mental distress, help/treatment-seeking behaviors, vitamin D and sleep problems. In the correlation test focused on seven exposures with significant interaction with PRS-SCZ, no significant or small (r2< 0.04) gene-environment correlations were estimated.  ConclusionThese findings reveal preliminary evidence for gene-environment interaction underlying PEs and suggest that genetic vulnerability and exposures might represent intertwined pathways leading to psychosis."

We explored this possibility by investigating the relationship between  gold standard measures of adiposity, fitness, selected proteomic biomarkers, and insulin sensitivity among a cohort of SAs and Europeans (EURs).  MethodsA total of 46 SAs and 41 EURs completed  conventional (lifestyle questionnaires, standard physical exam) as well as  gold standard (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan, cardiopulmonary exercise test, and insulin suppression test) assessments of adiposity, fitness, and insulin sensitivity. In a subset of 28 SAs and 36 EURs, we also measured the blood-levels of eleven IR-related proteins. We conducted Spearman correlation to identify correlates of steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) derived from the insulin suppression test, followed by multivariable linear regression analyses of SSPG, adjusting for age, sex and ancestral group.  ResultsSixteen of 30 measures significantly associated with SSPG, including one conventional and eight gold standard measures of adiposity, one conventional and one gold standard measure of fitness, and five proteins. Multivariable regressions revealed that gold standard measures and plasma proteins attenuated ancestral group differences in IR, suggesting their potential utility in assessing IR, especially among SAs.  ConclusionAncestral group differences in IR may be explained by accurate measures of adiposity and fitness, with specific proteins possibly serving as useful surrogates for these measures, particularly for SAs."

However, the prevalence of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs among Japanese has remained unclear. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence and correlates of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs in Japan using a nationwide survey of 28,175 residents aged 16-81 years old.  MethodsA nationally representative, cross-sectional self-administered survey was conducted from September to October 2021. To assess the number of COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, we used three questions from the Oxford Coronavirus Explanations, Attitudes, and Narratives Survey. Independent variables included general vaccine conspiracy beliefs, sociodemographic variables, information sources for COVID-19, trust in authorities, and fear of COVID-19.  ResultsAfter applying sampling weights and imputation, the estimated prevalence of holding at least one COVID-19 conspiracy belief was 24.4%. From a linear regression model, several factors were independently associated with conspiracy beliefs. Notably, people with the lowest level of education (lower secondary school) endorsed fewer COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs (B -0.089, vs. upper secondary school). Furthermore, higher socioeconomic backgrounds-such as higher income, higher wealth, and regular employment-were associated with endorsing conspiracy beliefs. Additionally, only 37.3% of respondents trusted the government of Japan, but paradoxically, trust in the government was positively associated with conspiracy beliefs (B 0.175, vs. distrust).  ConclusionsConspiracy beliefs about COVID-19 were prevalent in about a quarter of the Japanese population. Certain groups are more likely to endorse conspiracy beliefs, and targeting interventions towards these groups might be efficient in stemming the spread of conspiracy beliefs."

However, the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 transmission is far less well-characterized, and has major implications for public health, because it informs the indirect effects of vaccination in addition to its direct effects. Analysing the effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on transmission is challenging, because they must be considered in tandem with the time-varying reproduction number (Rt), while also accounting for regional variability, for example due to the presence of more transmissible variants.  MethodsWe fitted a Bayesian hierarchical model to previously obtained estimates of Rt to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination with one, two and three doses on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK during 2021. Vaccine effectiveness is defined as the proportional reduction in the time-varying reproduction number Rt. The model accounts for transmission at national and Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA)-level, and uses vaccination data provided by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), detailing the LTLA-specific proportions of people who have received doses one, two and three. The model also incorporates data on the proportion of wild-type, Alpha and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants over time in each LTLA, obtained from UKHSA and the COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium.  ResultsWe find that vaccination had moderate-to-large effectiveness against transmission for dose 1 (39.30%, 95% CrI 26.64% - 48.07%), and for dose 3 (48.69%, 95% CrI 27.97% - 71.30%), but negligible effects on dose 2, likely attributable to the coincident importation and dominance of the Delta variant in the UK. Nationally, our model fitted the previously estimated values of time-series of Rt values well, largely reproducing the reproduction number averaged across LTLAs for each timepoint. This lends support to our hypothesis that the extent of vaccination (or lack thereof) was a major determinant of transmission intensity. Our model fits further reproduced well the reproduction numbers at regional level, although outliers were less well captured, implying some degree of variation that is not explained by our model.  ConclusionsTo our knowledge, our analysis is the first evidence of the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination against its transmission at population level. We find that vaccination is an effective tool for the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, in addition to its well-documented effects on disease burden and mortality. Our results allow future assessment of the impact of vaccination accounting for several circulating variants and sociodemographic factors."

This study aims to investigate the association between night shift work and the risk of cholelithiasis, assess the potential modifying effects of genetic susceptibility, and explore the mediating roles of lifestyle factors.  MethodsA total of 219,810 subjects who were either in paid employment or self-employed were included in the UK Biobank. Information on current and lifetime employment were collected. Genetic risk was quantified and stratified by a polygenic risk score (PRS) incorporating 13 known cholelithiasis-associated loci. We used Cox proportional hazard models to investigate associations between night shift work and risk of cholelithiasis. Lifestyle factors measured at baseline were explored as potential mediators.  ResultsDuring a median follow-up of 13.76 years, 6450 incidents of cholelithiasis were documented. Compared with day workers, the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of cholelithiasis was 1.09 (1.01, 1.17) for individuals with rarely/some night shifts and 1.18 (1.04, 1.35) for those with usual/permanent night shifts. Among the 62,558 participants who had reports on lifetime experience of night shift work, those with a higher frequency of night shifts and a longer length of each night shift were associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis. Notably, individuals with usual/permanent night shifts and high genetic risk exhibited the highest risk of cholelithiasis (HR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.21, 1.81), with day workers at low genetic risk serving as the reference. Mediation analysis indicated that a substantial portion (24.6%) of the association was mediated by BMI, followed by unhealthy alcohol intake (4.5%) and sedentary time (1.8%).  ConclusionsNight shift work is associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis, with this relationship being largely mediated by lifestyle factors. These findings suggest that reducing the frequency and duration of night shifts may help mitigate the incidence of cholelithiasis among night shift workers, particularly for those with heightened genetic susceptibility."

System managers can mitigate the impact on patient care when they anticipate hospital admissions due to these viruses. Hospitalisation forecasts were used widely during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Now, resurgent seasonal respiratory pathogens add complexity to system planning. We describe how a suite of forecasts for respiratory pathogens, embedded in national and regional decision-making structures, were used to mitigate the impact on hospital systems and patient care.  We developed forecasting models predicting hospital admissions and bed occupancy two weeks ahead for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV in England over winter 2023/24. Bed occupancy forecasts were informed by the ensemble admissions models. Forecasts were delivered in real-time at multiple scales. The use of sample-based forecasting allowed for effective reconciliation and trend interpretation.  Admission forecasts, particularly RSV and influenza, showed high skill at regional levels. Bed occupancy forecasts had well-calibrated coverage, owing to informative admissions forecasts and slower moving trends. National admissions forecasts had mean absolute percentage errors of 27.3%, 30.9% and 15.7% for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV respectively, with corresponding 90% coverages of 0.439, 0.807 and 0.779.  These real-time winter infectious disease forecasts produced by the UK Health Security Agency for healthcare system managers played an informative role in mitigating seasonal pressures. The models were delivered regularly and shared widely across the system to key users. This was achieved by producing reliable, fast, and epidemiologically informed ensembles of models. Though, a higher diversity of model approaches could have improved forecast accuracy."

Four populations were included in the dataset: (1) patients with cancer (n=1,294,022); (2) patients with rheumatic conditions receiving pharmacotherapy (n=1,636,940); (3) non-cancer solid organ (n=249,797) and hematopoietic stem cell (n=30,172) transplant recipients; and (4) people from the general population including adults (>18 years of age; n=1,790,162) and pediatric patients (<18 years of age; n=198,907).  ConclusionsWe have created a complex real-world data system to address unanswered questions that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, by making the data broadly and freely available to academic researchers from the United States, the CRWDi real-world data system represents an important complement to existing consortia studies and clinical trials that have emerged during the healthcare crisis, and is readily reproducible for future purposing.  SummaryThe COVID-19 Real World Data infrastructure dataset contains 5.2 million deidentified patient records, with focus on immunocompromising conditions, and is freely available to approved researchers to study the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patient morbidities and outcomes."

MethodsThe study analyzed data from 6,953 individuals, examining vaccination statuses, sociodemographic profiles, comorbidities, COVID-19 test results, and other relevant variables. The cohort comprised predominantly mixed-race (51%), Caucasian (38%), and Black (9.5%) individuals, with 61% being female and 60% aged between 21-50 years. Prevalent comorbidities included hypertension (18.2%), diabetes (4.9%), and obesity (0.4%).  ResultsPopulation-weighted analysis revealed significant associations between sociodemographic factors and COVID-19 test outcomes. Younger age groups, particularly 11-30 years, had higher positivity rates, which declined with age. Caucasians exhibited higher positivity rates (40.1%) compared to other ethnicities. Cramers V indicated small correlations between symptoms and test outcomes, notably with loss of taste (V = 0.11) and smell (V = 0.08). Odds ratio analysis identified hypertension as significantly associated with higher COVID-19 positivity (OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.28-1.83, p < 0.001), while obesity was associated with lower positivity (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.02-0.63, p = 0.025). Symptoms such as fever, cough, loss of taste, loss of smell, and myalgia also showed significant associations with positive test outcomes.

The models used in phylodynamics typically assume that the sampling procedure is independent between infected individuals. However, this assumption does not hold for many epidemics, in particular for such sexually transmitted infections as HIV-1, for which partner notification schemes are included in health policies of many countries.  We developed an extension of phylodynamic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) models with partner notification (PN), and a simulator to generate trees under MTBD and MTBD-PN models. We proposed a non-parametric test for detecting partner notification in pathogen phylogenetic trees. Its application to simulated data showed that it is both highly specific and sensitive. For the simplest representative of the MTBD-PN family, the BD-PN model, we solved the differential equations and proposed a closed form solution for the likelihood function. We implemented it in a program, which estimates the model parameters and their confidence intervals from phylogenetic trees. It performed accurate estimations on simulated data, and detected partner notification in HIV-1 B epidemics in Zurich and the UK. Importantly, we showed that not accounting for partner notification when it is present leads to bias in parameter estimation with the BD model, while BD-PN parameter estimator performs well both in presence and in absence of partner notification.  Our PN test, MTBD-PN tree simulator and BD-PN parameter estimator are freely available at github.com/evolbioinfo/treesimulator and github.com/evolbioinfo/bdpn.  Author summaryPhylodynamic models can estimate epidemiological parameters such as the number of secondary infections Re from pathogen phylogenetic trees (i.e., genealogies, inferred from pathogen genomic sequences). These models do not account for partner notification (contact tracing), and instead assume that detection of new cases is independent between infected individuals. However, especially for sexually transmitted infections, partner notification plays an important role and is included in health policies of many countries.  We developed a phylodynamic model accounting for partner notification and a test for the detection of partner notification in pathogen phylogenetic trees. Our test and epidemiological parameter estimator showed good performance both on simulated and real data. We detected the presence of partner notification in the HIV-1 B epidemics in Zurich and the UK, and corrected the previous parameter estimates made without accounting for partner notification."

Three pathways were trialled: (A) on-site swabbing with local laboratory testing, (B) on-site swabbing with UKHSA-commissioned laboratory testing, and (C) postal swabbing with UKHSA-commissioned laboratory testing. Here, we compare pathways in relation to recruitment, testing coverage, participant acceptability, and UKHSA SIREN research team feedback.  MethodsWe conducted a mixed methods evaluation using metrics of quality assurance and study fidelity (participant recruitment and retention; multiplex PCR testing timing and coverage), an adapted NIHR  participant in research feedback questionnaire, and thematic analysis of a UKHSA SIREN research team workshop.  ResultsWith 7,774 participants recruited, target recruitment (N=7,500) was achieved. Thirty-nine sites took part in the sub-study (4,289 participants). Thirty-three used pathway A, and six used pathway B. 3,485 participants enrolled to pathway C (27.8% of invitees). The median number of tests per participant was similar across pathways (6; 4; 5). However, sites using local laboratories showed a wide variation in the date they switched to multiplex testing (28th November 2022 to 16th March 2023). Consequently, influenza and RSV testing coverage was higher for pathways using UKHSA-commissioned laboratories (100.0% vs 45.6% at local laboratories). 1,204/7,774 (15.5%) participants completed the feedback survey. All pathways were acceptable to participants; 98.9% of postal and 97.5% of site-based participants  would consider taking part again.  ConclusionTransitioning SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing to include influenza and RSV was challenging to achieve rapidly across multiple sites. The postal testing pathway proved more agile, and UKHSA-commissioned laboratory testing provided more comprehensive data collection than local laboratory testing. This sub-study indicates that postal protocols are effective, adaptable at pace, and acceptable to participants."

We conducted a real-life case-control study on a cohort of outpatients, with Omicron SARS-CoV-2 infection to assess the effectiveness of MNP in reducing the occurrence of hospital admission, admission in intensive care unit (ICU) and death at day 28.  Materials and methodsCases were enrolled among SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects that sought medical care during the first five days of symptoms from January 1st, 2022, to December 31st, 2022, and received MNP. Control participants were selected from a regional database among those who tested positive during the study period and did not receive antiviral treatment for SARS-CoV-2.  Results1382 patients were included (cases: 146, controls: 1236).

In this study, we report an antibiotic prescription pattern informed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) results, where clinicians de-escalate antibiotics based on the combination of quantitative cultures and multiplex PCR rapid diagnostic tests.  MethodsWe analyzed data from SCRIPT, a single-center prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients who underwent a BAL for suspected pneumonia. We used the novel Narrow Antibiotic Therapy (NAT) score to quantify day-by-day antibiotic prescription pattern for each suspected pneumonia episode etiology (bacterial, viral, mixed bacterial/viral, microbiology-negative, and non-pneumonia control). We also analyzed and compared clinical outcomes for each pneumonia etiology, including unfavorable outcomes (a composite of in-hospital mortality, discharge to hospice, or requiring lung transplantation during hospitalization), duration of ICU stay, and duration of intubation. Clinical outcomes were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test and Fishers exact test.  ResultsWe included 686 patients with 927 pneumonia episodes. NAT score analysis indicated that an antibiotic de-escalation pattern was evident in all pneumonia etiologies except resistant bacterial pneumonia. Microbiology-negative pneumonia was treated similarly to susceptible bacterial pneumonia in terms of antibiotic spectrum. Over a quarter of the time in viral pneumonia episodes, antibiotics were completely discontinued. Unfavorable outcomes were comparable across all pneumonia etiologies. Patients with viral and mixed bacterial/viral pneumonia had longer durations of ICU stay and intubation.  ConclusionsBAL quantitative cultures and multiplex PCR rapid diagnostic tests resulted in prompt antibiotic de-escalation in critically ill pneumonia patients. There was no evidence of increased incidence of unfavorable outcomes.  Key pointsWe found that bronchoalveolar lavage-based diagnostics is associated with antibiotic de-escalation, including to no antibiotics in more than a quarter of cases where only a virus is recovered."

When self-testing policies are in place a decreased sensitivity of the virus to RDTs can give benefits for viral spread. However, to monitor for reduced sensitivity of RDTs we rely on the collection of SARS-CoV-2 positive samples from RDT negative patients. Infectieradar, a national participatory surveillance that registers influenza-like symptoms is used as a framework to study false-negative RDT results due to emergence of new virus variants.  MethodsParticipants report weekly on RDT use and symptoms linked to Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI). Each week, all RDT positive and a sample of 200 among RDT negative but symptomatic participants were invited to send in nose throat swabs (NTS). SARS-CoV-2 Ct-values are determined using RT-PCR on NTS samples for RDT positive and RDT (false) negative participants and compared. Sequencing is performed on all eligible samples for phylogenetic analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and the whole genome sequence. NTS samples of participants with discordant RT-PCR and RDT results are also analyzed using RDTs by professionals in the laboratory.  ResultsBetween October 2022 and October 2023, our study had 16,893 participants and we collected 1,757 self-test-positive/NTS PCR positive samples and 359 self-test-negative/NTS PCR positive samples (RDT-/PCR+). These participants were asked to take a SARS-CoV-2 RDT upon symptoms. Within SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive participants, we did not find characteristics that differ in SARS-CoV-2 RDT negative versus positive participants. There were no associations with specific changes in the N protein nor did our phylogenetic analysis show clustering of RDT negative samples.  ConclusionEvaluating brand-specific RDT performance in Dutch population and false-negative RDT analyses, led to no evidence for SARS-CoV-2 evolution affecting RDT sensitivity. The participatory surveillance program Infectieradar is a powerful tool for our national surveillance on acute respiratory illnesses, as well as for research purposes. Since this framework offered both self-testing and the gold standard of PCR testing results."

The Asia Pacific (APAC) region, with little exposure to previous mpox waves, is particularly vulnerable to local transmission triggered by importation. While this highlights the importance of early preparedness, current knowledge of the viruss transmission dynamics remains too limited to effectively inform policy-making and resource planning.  MethodsA compartmental model was constructed to characterise the potential mpox transmission triggered by importation in an APAC city. Outbreaks were simulated under diverse hypothetical scenarios considering transmission mechanisms, different affected subpopulations, levels of disease transmissibility, and importation frequencies. The impacts of various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including isolation, and vaccination strategies were projected and compared.  FindingsUp to 30% of the population would be infected in the scenario of high sexual and moderate non-sexual transmissibility in the general community, with minimal impact from importation frequency on outbreak size and healthcare burden. The sequential introduction of mandatory home isolation for diagnosed cases, pre-departure screening of international arrivals, and contact tracing were projected to lower the peak outbreak size by 35%, 0.04%, and 1.1%, respectively, while the reduction would be 30% with proper vaccination by prioritising the sexually active group. These measures would significantly decrease disease morbidity and mortality rates, thereby alleviating the diseases pressure on healthcare systems.  InterpretationThe potential mpox outbreak in the APAC setting could be alleviated through strong surveillance and timely response from stakeholders. NPIs are recommended over vaccination for outbreak management due to their demonstrated effectiveness and practicability."

Research Design and MethodsUsing GWAS summary statistics from the DIAGRAM consortium and Million Veteran Program, we developed multi-ancestry Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) polygenic risk scores (T2D-PRSs) useful in admixed Hispanic/Latino individuals. We estimated the association of the T2D-PRS with cross-sectional and incident DM in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). We conducted a mediation analysis with T2D-PRSs as an exposure, incident DM as an outcome, and OSA as a mediator.

We aimed to investigate the associations of insomnia symptoms and trajectories with the risk of incident CVD.  MethodsThis study used data from the Health and Retirement Study. Insomnia symptoms included non-restorative sleep, difficulty initiating sleep, early morning awakening, and difficulty maintaining sleep, classified on a scale ranging from 0 to 8. We also identified four distinct trajectories of insomnia symptoms: low, decreasing, increasing, and high insomnia symptoms. Examined outcomes included incident heart disease, stroke, and the combination of the two referred as CVD in the present study. Cox proportional hazard models were used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) after adjusting for potential confounders.  ResultsA total of 12 102 participants aged 50 years or over without CVD at baseline were included. During a median follow-up of 10.2 years, 3 962 first CVD events occurred (3 372 heart disease and 1 200 stroke). Participants experiencing one (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.05-1.27]), two (HR, 1.16 [ 95% CI, 1.05-1.28]), or three to four (HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.15-1.38]) insomnia symptoms had a higher risk of incident CVD compared to those not experiencing any insomnia symptoms. After a median follow-up of 8.4 years after the visit 2, 2 375 first CVD events occurred (1 981 heart disease and 705 stroke).

MethodsWe collected both symptom data and nose- and throat samples from symptomatic people during the 2022/2023 respiratory season in a large participatory surveillance study in the Netherlands, and tested these for 18 respiratory viruses including SARS-CoV-2. We compared reported health status, symptoms and odds of having a mono respiratory viral infection or co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and another respiratory virus.  ResultsIn total 4,655 samples were included with 22% (n=1,017) testing SARS-CoV-2 positive. Of these 11% (n=116) also tested positive for a second respiratory virus.

With imported cases sporadically reported globally, concerns have emerged about the potential of widespread transmission in the general community after importation events. Border control measures, such as screening and quarantining of arriving travellers, may help mitigate this risk and prevent localized outbreaks in the event of global spread.  MethodsWe proposed nine border control strategies and evaluated their effectiveness in reducing importation risk using 10,000 microsimulations of individual infection profiles and PCR testing results under scenarios with varying disease prevalence levels (0.01%, 0.05%, and 0.1%) in the country of origin.  ResultsThe proposed border-control measures would reduce missed cases by 40.1% (39.1%-41.0%), 49.8% (48.8%-50.8%), and 58.1% (57.1%-59.0%) for predeparture, on-arrival, and both tests, respectively. Replacing the on-arrival test with a seven-day quarantine and post-quarantine testing would lower the count to 21.8% (20.9%-22.6%). Quarantine-only strategies showed a linear increase in effectiveness against duration, reaching a 90.4% (89.8%-91.0%) reduction with a 28-day quarantine. Disparities in distributions of missed case counts across strategies would become more pronounced at higher prevalence levels, with stringent approaches like quarantining followed by post-quarantine screening and 28-day quarantine keeping counts below two per 10,000 travellers, even at 0.1% prevalence.  ConclusionsWhen disease prevalence in the country of origin is low (0.01%), less restrictive approaches such as single on-arrival testing or a 14-day quarantine can maintain very low imported case counts of one or below. At higher prevalences, seven-day quarantining followed by post-quarantine testing, or 28-day quarantining is required to maintain similar effects. Decision makers will face balancing importation risk management and the negative impacts of such interventions to maintain safe international travel."

For dengue, reconstructing exposure and susceptibility statuses from the measured FOI is of particular significance as prior exposure is a strong risk factor for severe disease. FOI can be measured via many study designs. Longitudinal serology are considered gold standard measurements, as they directly track the transition of seronegative individuals to seropositive due to incident infections (seroincidence). Cross-sectional serology can provide estimates of FOI by contrasting seroprevalence across ages. Age of reported cases can also be used to infer FOI. Agreement of these measurements, however, have not been assessed. Using 26 years of data from cohort studies and hospital-attended cases from Kamphaeng Phet province, Thailand, we found FOI estimates from the three sources to be highly inconsistent. Annual FOI estimates from seroincidence was 2.46 to 4.33-times higher than case-derived FOI. Correlation between seroprevalence-derived and case-derived FOI was moderate (correlation coefficient=0.46) and no systematic bias. Through extensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that incongruences between methods can result from failing to account for dengue antibody kinetics, assay noise, and heterogeneity in FOI across ages. Extending standard inference models to include these processes reconciled the FOI and susceptibility estimates. Our results highlight the importance of comparing inferences across multiple data types to uncover additional insights not attainable through a single data type/analysis.  Significance statementDengue virus infections are surging globally. Knowing who, where, and how many people are at risk of infection is crucial in determining means to protect them. Here, we compare three current approaches in measuring risk (two involving blood samples and one involving case counts) to estimate the risk of infection. Estimates derived from each method differed greatly. By accounting for rise and falls of antibodies following infections, noise in the antibody titer measurements, and heterogeneity in infection risk across ages, we reconciled the measurements. As measurements from blood samples and case counts are pillars in uncovering risk of most infectious diseases, our results signifies integrating these processes into risk measurements of pathogens beyond dengue virus."

Neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis), while crucial for pathogen clearance, can contribute to organ dysfunction in sepsis. This study aimed to identify key NETosis-related genes for prognostication in neonatal sepsis.  MethodsWe analysed whole blood transcriptome datasets (GSE26440, GSE26378, GSE25504) from neonates with sepsis and controls. Differentially expressed NETosis genes (DE-NET genes) were identified, and a machine learning approach was used to select the most influential genes. A NET score model was constructed and validated using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). The models performance was evaluated using ROC analysis. The interplay between key-NET genes and the complement-coagulation (CC) system was investigated. Clinical samples were also collected for validation.  ResultsSixteen DE-NET genes were identified, and LASSO further refined these to 8 key-NET genes. The key-NET gene signature and NET score model showed excellent predictive performance (AUCs > 89%) in distinguishing survivors from non-survivors. Mediation analysis revealed that key-NET gene expression precedes and potentially drives complement-coagulation activation.  ConclusionsWe present an 8-gene prognostic model for risk stratification in neonatal sepsis, based on early blood transcript signatures in neonates. Our findings underscore the central role of NETosis in sepsis- induced coagulopathy, revealing potential therapeutic targets for intervention.

Persistent endothelial dysfunction (ED) is a potential driver of ongoing symptoms. Yet, the underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear.  MethodsIn this prospective observational study, we characterized 41 PCS patients and 24 healthy controls (HC, matched out of n = 204, recruited before the pandemic) and investigated the effect of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein 1 (S1) and plasma from PCS patients on human retinal endothelial cells (HREC).  ResultsPlasma samples from PCS patients exhibited significantly elevated erythropoietin, VEGF and MCP-1 alongside decreased IL-6 levels compared to HC. Low Haemoglobin and Haematocrit were negatively associated with PCS severity. VEGF levels were positively correlated with Anti-S1 IgG levels in patients and upregulated on mRNA level in HREC exposed to S1. Additionally, S1 exposure promoted ROS production and transiently activated HIF-1 in HREC. Persistent activation of HIF-2 by S1 led to disrupted endothelial integrity. HREC exposed to plasma from severely affected PCS patients showed increased ROS and compromised barrier function. Treatment with Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, restored barrier integrity in HREC exposed to S1 or PCS-plasma.

C_LIO_LISpike protein 1 (S1) alone and PCS patients plasma induce endothelial dysfunction primarily through HIF-2 activation. C_LIO_LIBoth S1 and PCS plasma cause oxidative stress and disrupting endothelial integrity. C_LIO_LIInhibition of HIF-2 effectively restores endothelial barrier integrity disrupted by S1 and PCS plasma. C_LI  Persistent circulation of spike proteins can sustain chronic inflammation and immune activation in patients with PCS. Here we show that plasma from PCS patients exhibits significantly elevated levels of VEGF which positively correlates with Anti-S1 IgG. Low haemoglobin was associated with higher Anti-S1 IgG titres and correlated with a higher C19-YRS severity score. Levels of EPO were higher in PCS patients, with a more pronounced effect observed in patients with cardiovascular symptoms. In human retinal endothelial cells, both S1 and plasma from PCS patients primarily induce ED through HIF-2 activation, rather than NF-{kappa}B. Both factors lead to significant oxidative stress, evidenced by increased ROS production which in turn disrupts endothelial barrier integrity and function. Notably, Belzutifan, a HIF-2 inhibitor, can restore this compromised endothelial function, offering a potential therapeutic target for PCS.

We identified that ASF emerged in total 178 locations in all 11 districts of Mizoram between March-July 2021, after a peak in June, and the disease continued to spread till the end of 2021 before re-emergence in March 2022. The overall morbidity rate and mortality rate of ASF between March-July 2021 in Mizoram were estimated to be 33.8% and 31.1%, while the average morbidity rate and the mortality rate of 10 districts were found to be 29.5% and 27.6% respectively. Overall CFR of ASF between March-July 2021 was estimated to be 92.1% and the average of all 11 districts was found to be 96.1%. Toward the end of 2021, the mortality rate increased by a total of 42.7% change and an average of 25.3% change. We estimated an overall 70% depopulation of susceptible pigs by disease and culling by end of 2021. This report is evidence that ASF has remained catastrophic and, keeping in view the complex nature and history of the virus on genotype adaptability associated with a high propensity for transboundary expansion, the virus continues to be a threat."

MethodsThis prospective cohort study included participants with valid wrist-worn accelerometer data from the UK Biobank. We estimated stepping intensity using ten different cadence-based metrics, including eight peak-cadence metrics (defined as averaged steps / min of the highest but not necessarily consecutive minutes) that most of whom have appeared in prior literature, plus two non-peak-cadence metrics: 1) average daily cadence, defined as steps/accelerometer wearing mins, and 2) average cadence of purposeful steps, defined as averaged steps / min of minutes with [&ge;]40 steps. We rescaled each metric into a standardised cadence scale with mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1, using (absolute-mean)/SD. We compared the dose-response associations of each stepping intensity estimation metrics with mortality outcomes using previously published modelling involving Cox-restricted-cubic-spline model, presented as overlay plots on standardised and absolute cadence scales.  ResultsAmong 70,336 participants (age [SD], 61.6 [7.8] years; female, 40,933 [58%]) followed up for a median of 8.0 years, all cadence-based metrics, besides the average cadence of purposeful steps, exhibited a comparable beneficial dose-response association with ACM/CVD/cancer mortality, with 95% CI largely overlapped (e.g., at -0.2 standardised steps/min, the hazard ratio (HR) of ACM for peak 1- and peak 30-min cadence were: 0.72, 95%CI [0.65, 0.82] and 0.66 [0.60, 0.73], respectively). The average cadence of purposeful steps only did not show dose-response associations with mortality outcomes (e.g., the HR that corresponds to the standardised median for the average cadence of purposeful steps in ACM was 0.98 [95% CI: 0.86, 1.12].  ConclusionBesides the average cadence of purposeful steps, all stepping intensity estimation metrics demonstrated comparable beneficial dose-response associations with mortality of all-cause, CVD and cancer, suggesting these cadence-based metrics may be used interchangeably for estimating associations of free-living stepping intensity with health outcomes and applied in different research scenarios accordingly."

Post-licensure monitoring is essential to confirm these benefits in real-world settings.  OBJECTIVETo evaluate the real-world effectiveness of nirsevimab against medically attended RSV infections in infants and to assess how effectiveness varies by disease severity, dosage, and time since immunization.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTSThis test-negative case-control study used inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room data from the Yale New Haven Health System. Nirsevimab-eligible infants who were tested for RSV using polymerase chain reaction between October 1, 2023 and May 9, 2024 were included. Cases were infants with confirmed RSV infections; controls were those who tested negative.  EXPOSURENirsevimab immunization, verified through state immunization registries.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESEffectiveness was estimated using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, calendar month, and individual risk factors. Separate models examined effectiveness by clinical setting, disease severity, dose, and time since immunization. Broader outcomes, including all-cause LRTI and LRTI-related hospitalization, were also analyzed, with stratification by early and late respiratory seasons.  RESULTSThe analytic sample included 3,090 infants (median age 6.7 months, IQR 3.6-9.7), with 680 (22.0%) RSV-positive and 2,410 (78.0%) RSV-negative. 21 (3.1%) RSV-positive and 309 (12.8%) RSV-negative infants received nirsevimab. Effectiveness against RSV infection was 68.4% (95% CI, 50.3%-80.8%). Effectiveness was 61.6% (95% CI, 35.6%-78.6%) for outpatient visits and 80.5% (95% CI, 52.0%-93.5%) for hospitalizations. The highest effectiveness, 84.6% (95% CI, 58.7%-95.6%), was observed against severe RSV outcomes requiring ICU admission or high-flow oxygen. Although effectiveness against RSV infections declined over time, it remained significant at 55% (95% credible interval, 16%-75%) at 14 weeks post-immunization. Protective effectiveness was also observed against all-cause LRTI and LRTI-related hospitalizations during peak RSV season (49.4% [95% CI, 10.7%-72.9%] and 79.1% [95% CI, 27.6%-94.9%], respectively). However, from February to May, when RSV positivity was low, effectiveness against these broader outcomes was negligible.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCENirsevimab provided substantial protection against RSV-related outcomes for at least three months. These findings support the continued use of nirsevimab and provide evidence that may help build public confidence in the immunization program.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSWhat is the effectiveness of nirsevimab against medically attended respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in infants?  Findings680 RSV test-positive cases and 2,410 RSV test-negative controls were included in this test-negative case-control study. Nirsevimabs effectiveness was 69% against RSV infections, 81% against RSV-associated hospitalization, and 85% against severe RSV disease. Effectiveness against RSV infection declined from 79% at 2 weeks post-immunization to 55% at 14 weeks post-immunization.  MeaningNirsevimab provides strong protection against a wide range of RSV outcomes, but its effectiveness diminishes over time. These data can be utilized to optimize nirsevimabs implementation and sustain its uptake."

The primary aim of our study is to elucidate the complex network of interactions between SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis, and lung cancer employing a bioinformatics and network biology approach. Lung cancer is the leading cause of significant illness and death connected to cancer worldwide. Tuberculosis (TB) is a prevalent medical condition induced by the Mycobacterium bacteria. It mostly affects the lungs but may also have an influence on other areas of the body. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) causes a risk of respiratory complications between lung cancer and tuberculosis. SARS-CoV-2 impacts the lower respiratory system and causes severe pneumonia, which can significantly increase the mortality risk in individuals with lung cancer. We conducted transcriptome analysis to determine molecular biomarkers and common pathways in lung cancer, TB, and COVID-19, which provide understanding into the association of SARS-CoV-2 to lung cancer and tuberculosis. Based on the compatible RNA-seq data, our research employed GREIN and NCBIs Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) to perform differential gene expression analysis. Our study exploited three RNA-seq datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)--GSE171110, GSE89403, and GSE81089--to identify distinct relationships between differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis, and lung cancer. We identified 30 common genes among SARS-CoV-2, tuberculosis, and lung cancer (25 upregulated genes and 5 downregulated genes). We analyzed the following five databases: WikiPathway, KEGG, Bio Carta, Elsevier Pathway and Reactome. Using Cytohubbas MCC and Degree methods, We determined the top 15 hub genes resulting from the PPI interaction. These hub genes can serve as potential biomarkers, leading to novel treatment strategies for disorders under investigation. Transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) were identified as the molecules that control the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of interest, either during transcription or after transcription. We identified 35 prospective therapeutic compounds that form significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SARS-CoV-2, lung cancer, and tuberculosis, which could potentially serve as medications. We hypothesized that the potential medications that emerged from this investigation may have therapeutic benefits."

We conducted a longitudinal study to validate a risk-differentiation tool for predicting HIV or HSV-2 acquisition among HIV-negative youth.  SettingPopulation-based household survey in east Zimbabwe.  MethodsHIV and HSV-2 status and HIV behavioural risk factors were assessed in two surveys conducted 12 months apart among young people. Associations between risk-behaviours and combined HIV/HSV-2 incident infection were estimated using proportional hazards models. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of risk-differentiation questions in predicting HIV/HSV-2 acquisition and quantified changes between surveys among low, medium, and high-risk categories.  ResultsIn total, 44 HIV/HSV-2 seroconversions were observed in 1812 person-years of follow up (2.43/100PY, 95%CI: 1.71-3.15); 50% of incident cases reported never having had sex at baseline. Risk of HIV/HSV-2 acquisition was higher for those reporting non-regular partners (women: HR=2.71, 95% CI:1.12-6.54, men: HR=1.37, 95%CI: 0.29-6.38) and those reporting having a partner with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) (HR=7.62 (1.22-47.51).

Two-part population-based surveys, which test the infection status and also assess symptoms, have been used to estimate{psi} . Here, we identified a widely prevalent confounding effect that compromises these estimates and devised a formalism to adjust for it. The symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are not all specific to SARS-CoV-2. They can be triggered by a host of other conditions, such as influenza virus infection. By not accounting for the source of the symptoms, the surveys may misclassify individuals experiencing symptoms from other conditions as symptomatic for SARS-CoV-2, thus underestimating{psi} . We developed a rigorous formalism to adjust for this confounding effect and derived a facile formula for the adjusted prevalence,{psi} adj. We applied it to data from 50 published serosurveys, conducted on the general populations from 28 nations.

Hospitalisation rates increased with age for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and RSV, with SARS-CoV-2 showing the highest rate, followed by influenza and RSV.  In the multi-state model, RSV infection significantly increased ICU admission risk (HR: 2.1, 95%, p = 0.037). Age on admission (HR: 1.1, 95%, p < 0.001) and Charlson score (HR: 1.4, 95%, p = 0.001) were associated with transitioning from admission to death. ICU to death risks included age at admission (HR: 1.7, 95%, p < 0.001).  RVIs in adults 60 years and older are associated with high hospitalisation and mortality rates, primarily driven by influenza and SARS-CoV-2, followed by RSV.

Currently, most of the cases was in the rural of eastern part of the country. However, malaria risk factors amongst rural adult were less documented. This study investigated malaria risk factors amongst rural adults in East Nusa Tenggara Province (ENTP).  MethodsA community based cross-sectional study was conducted to interview 1495 rural adults in ENTP. A multi-stage cluster random sampling technique was applied to collect data on malaria history, demographic, behavioural and environmental factors of malaria of participants. Logistic regression model was applied to decide significant factors associated with malaria.  ResultsThe prevalence of malaria was 13.4%. The prevalence of malaria was significantly higher for adults with low level of malaria knowledge (Adjusted odd ratio (AOR): 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38 - 4.27) compared to those with high malaria knowledge level, having moderate malaria knowledge level (AOR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.11 - 3.57) compared to those high malaria knowledge level, having no education (AOR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.37 - 3.45) compared to those junior high school or above education level, outdoor occupation (AOR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.22 - 2.68) compared to indoor occupation, having family size > 4 (AOR 2.08, 95% CI: 1.52 -2.87) compared to those [&le;] 4  ConclusionThe study revealed the prevalence of malaria amongst rural adults in this province was high. The study highlights the power of malaria knowledge level on the prediction of malaria prevalence amongst rural adults.

This report explore the prevalence of these viruses in Iran through a systematic review and meta-analysis.  MethodsThe present survey was performed with a systematic review and meta-analysis method on the seroprevalence of WNV, CHIKV, and DENV using the ELISA test. Based on this, by search in Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Science Direct, and Google Scholar scientific databases, all relevant published papers were sorted out and reviewed. Power ratification of data was carried out with a random effects model in meta-analysis, meta-regression, I2 index, and Egger test.  ResultsTwelve published papers between 2000 and 2024 were embodied in this meta-analysis report. The seroprevalence of positive ELISA test for WNV in Iran was estimated at 12.9% (CI=95%: 7.4-18.4), and for CHIKV at 6.2% (CI=95%: 0.6-11.8). Regarding DENV, only two studies were conducted with a zero prevalence in one study, and a seroprevalence of 5.6% in another study.  ConclusionAccording to these data, WNV, CHIKV, and DENV fevers have been detected in Iran using ELISA test. Considering the seropositivity of WNV and CHIKV, and the finding of these viruses from several provinces, it could be for granted that these two viruses are ubiquitous and DENV fever is sporadic in Iran.  Author SummaryArboviruses, including Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), and West Nile (WNV), pose significant health threats globally, with increasing infections reported, including in Iran. This report conducts a systematic review and meta-analysis of the seroprevalence of these viruses in Iran through ELISA testing. A total of twelve studies published from 2000 to 2024 were analyzed, revealing a seroprevalence of 12.9% for WNV and 6.2% for CHIKV, while DENV showed a mixed prevalence of 0% in one study and 5.6% in another. The results suggest that WNV and CHIKV are widespread in Iran, whereas DENV appears to be sporadic."

These models attempt to predict which genetic variants circulating at the time of vaccine strain selection will be dominant 12 months later in the influenza season targeted by vaccination campaign. Forecasting models depend on hemagglutinin (HA) sequences from the WHOs Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System to identify currently circulating groups of related strains (clades) and estimate clade fitness for forecasts. However, the average lag between collection of a clinical sample and the submission of its sequence to the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) EpiFlu database is [~]3 months. Submission lags complicate the already difficult 12-month forecasting problem by reducing understanding of current clade frequencies at the time of forecasting. These constraints of a 12-month forecast horizon and 3-month average submission lags create an upper bound on the accuracy of any long-term forecasting model. The global response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic revealed that modern vaccine technology like mRNA vaccines can reduce how far we need to forecast into the future to 6 months or less and that expanded support for sequencing can reduce submission lags to GISAID to 1 month on average. To determine whether these recent advances could also improve long-term forecasts for seasonal influenza, we quantified the effects of reducing forecast horizons and submission lags on the accuracy of forecasts for A/H3N2 populations. We found that reducing forecast horizons from 12 months to 6 or 3 months reduced average absolute forecasting errors to 25% and 50% of the 12-month average, respectively. Reducing submission lags provided little improvement to forecasting accuracy but decreased the uncertainty in current clade frequencies by 50%. These results show the potential to substantially improve the accuracy of existing influenza forecasting models by modernizing influenza vaccine development and increasing global sequencing capacity."

Pathogen genome sequences and their associated sampling times are the essential data in every analysis. However, sampling times are usually associated with hospitalisation or testing dates and can sometimes be used to identify individual patients, posing a threat to patient confidentiality. To lower this risk, sampling times are often given with reduced date-resolution to the month or year, which can potentially bias inference of epidemiological parameters. Here, we characterise the extent to which reduced date-resolution biases phylodynamic analyses across a diverse range of empirical and simulated datasets. We develop a practical guideline on when date-rounding biases phylodynamic inference and we show that this bias is both unpredictable in its direction and compounds with decreasing date-resolution, higher substitution rates, and shorter sampling intervals. We conclude by discussing future solutions that prioritise patient confidentiality and propose a method for safer sharing of sampling dates by translating them uniformly by a random number."

The COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted its burden.  ObjectiveTo estimate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sepsis incidence, etiology and associated hospitalization costs in metropolitan France.  MethodsThis retrospective observational study used data drawn from a cohort of hospitalized sepsis patients in Frances national healthcare database. Sepsis was identified through both explicit ICD-10 codes (E-sepsis) and implicit codes (I-sepsis). Participants included all patients aged 15 years or older hospitalized with E-sepsis or I-sepsis in metropolitan France between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022. Patient and hospital stay characteristics were described by sepsis type (E-sepsis, I-sepsis) and overall. The distribution of sepsis etiology was estimated for each year. Annual incidence rates were estimated overall and by sepsis type and etiology. Total and median per-stay hospitalization costs were calculated.  ResultsThe total age- and sex-standardized sepsis incidence rate per 100,000 increased slightly from 2018 (446, 95% CI 444.2 to 447.7) to 2020 (457, 95% CI 455.1 to 458.6) and then decreased in 2022 (382, 95% CI 380.2-383.7) (p <.0001). Incidence rates decreased for both E-sepsis and bacterial sepsis during the pandemic period, whereas I-sepsis incidence increased in 2020 and 2021, associated with a marked increase in viral sepsis and co-infections (p <.0001 for E- and I-sepsis). Viral sepsis represented about 10% of all sepsis cases during the pandemic, but only about 1% prior to the pandemic. Total sepsis-associated hospitalization costs and extra medication costs increased during the pandemic. Characteristics of patients and their hospital stays were overall stable over the five-year study period.  ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a higher burden of sepsis in French hospitals and an increase in hospital stay costs. Critically, our study highlights the need for introducing explicit viral sepsis codes within the ICD-11 classification system and for achieving a consensus on its definition in order to robustly estimate sepsis incidence."

Although EDS usually occurs in conjunction with insufficient sleep, and other sleep and circadian disorders, recent studies have shown unique genetic markers and metabolic pathways underlying EDS. Here, we aimed to further elucidate the biological profile of EDS using large scale single- and pathway-level metabolomics analyses.  MethodsMetabolomics data were available for 877 metabolites in 6,071 individuals from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) and EDS was assessed using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire. We performed linear regression for each metabolite on continuous ESS, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and physiological confounders, and in sex specific groups. Subsequently, gaussian graphical modelling was performed coupled with pathway and enrichment analyses to generate a holistic interactive network of the metabolomic profile of EDS associations.  FindingsWe identified seven metabolites belonging to steroids, sphingomyelin, and long chain fatty acids sub-pathways in the primary model associated with EDS, and an additional three metabolites in the male-specific analysis. The identified metabolites particularly played a role in steroid hormone biosynthesis.  InterpretationOur findings indicate that an EDS metabolomic profile is characterized by endogenous and dietary metabolites within the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway, with some pathways that differ by sex. Our findings identify potential pathways to target for addressing the causes or consequences of EDS and related sleep disorders.  FundingDetails regarding funding supporting this work and all studies involved are provided in the acknowledgments section.  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere is a growing recognition of the paramount importance of sleep on health and cardiometabolic disease. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), one of the key common sleep treatment targets, has been linked to increased risk of mortality, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, car accidents as well as decrease in life quality, and productivity. Despite its impact on health, much remains unknown about the biological mechanisms of EDS and if those mechanisms are independent from other sleep disorders. Recent genetic evidence that shows that EDS is associated with specific genetic biomarkers supports the need to further study the underlying biology of EDS.  Added value of this studyHere, we used measurements of metabolites, the products and by-products of metabolism to identify the metabolomic profile of EDS. Metabolites are produced by the biological reactions within the body via proteins--themselves products of genes--and by the breakdown of external sources such as nutritional intake and breathing air pollutants. Therefore, metabolomics enables study of the effects of nutrition, environmental exposures, and genetics. In this study we aimed to identify the metabolites that were associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Additionally, we mapped these metabolites into a publicly available online biological network of human metabolism pathways to obtain an understanding of our findings on a larger scale.  Implications of all the available evidenceIdentifying the metabolites and pathways related to daytime sleepiness provides insights into the biological mechanisms of EDS and suggests future research opportunities to identify targets for prevention, prediction, and treatments for EDS and potentially other sleep disorders coupled with sleepiness. In this study we found 7 such metabolites--some endogenously synthesised and some obtained from dietary sources--associated with EDS. The network analysis implicated the steroid hormone biosynthesis pathway as a shared pathway underlying those metabolites, and identified linkages to key metabolites related to sleep: melatonin and cortisol metabolism."

Extensive research in adult populations suggests the etiology is complex and indicates that early childhood exposures could have an integral role.  ObjectivesTo systematically identify, summarize, and compare research in children living in CKDu endemic areas or with relevant CKDu-related exposures.  MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted in six databases for studies that report kidney health outcomes of pediatric populations living in proximity to CKDu-affected areas with no limitations on geography or study design. Studies were independently screened for inclusion and underwent quality assessment using the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) or the JBI Critical Appraisal Tool for Cohort Studies based on the study design by at least two authors. Data are compared narratively and graphically.  ResultsWe included twenty peer-reviewed publications and two meeting abstracts from eight different countries. The most common study design involved cross-sectional analysis of biological specimens from children in an established CKDu endemic area. Marked decreases in estimated glomerular filtration rate were generally not identified and prevalence of albuminuria differed widely between countries. Novel urinary biomarkers frequently demonstrated subclinical kidney damage, although the specific biomarker(s) varied between studies. Epidemiologic factors associated with evidence of subclinical kidney damage in children included proximity to agriculture or agrochemicals. Despite heterogenous study outcomes, all studies concluded that there were signs of kidney injury in children living in CKDu endemic areas or with a CKDu-relevant environmental exposure.  ConclusionThis systematic review suggests that the pathophysiologic process leading to CKDu may begin prior to adulthood. Future longitudinal research aimed at elucidating the multifaceted factors and exposures impacting entire communities, including children, is imperative for disease prevention strategies."

This has also influenced respiratory infections role in childhood mortality. Surveillance of common respiratory viruses in Ghana is limited, making it crucial to assess the prevalence of respiratory viral infections, particularly in children, in the post-pandemic era. This study provides data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses and the associated risk factors in children aged 5 or younger in an urban paediatric hospital setting.  MethodsThe study was a cross-sectional study with a convenience sampling method, conducted in four health facilities: Asokwa Childrens Hospital, HopeXchange Medical Centre, University Health Services-KNUST, and Kumasi South Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, between August 2022 and June 2023. Recruitment was not done in parallel in each hospital. Oropharyngeal swabs were collected from children [&le;] 5 years old and screened by RT-qPCR for common respiratory viruses.  ResultsOut of the 303 patients enrolled in the study, 165 (54.4%) were male, and 122 (40.3%) were aged from 13 to 36 months. The median age of the patients was 19 months. The most common symptoms reported were cough (87.0%), runny nose (87.0%), and fever (72.0%). Respiratory viruses were detected in 100 (33.0%) of the samples, with 36 (12.0%) testing positive for Human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 27 (8.9%) for RSV, and 20 (6.6%) for Human Adenovirus (HAdV). In 8.0% of the cases, multiple viruses were detected, with HAdV being the most common (75.0%). Children under 6 months (AOR: 4.81, 95% CI: 1.20-24.60) had a higher risk of RSV detection compared to children aged 37 to 60 months. Furthermore, it was found that caregivers with tertiary education had a higher risk of HMPV detection (AOR: 6.91, 95% CI: 1.71-47.3).  ConclusionThe studys findings emphasize RSV infection in very young children and the potentially significant role of HMPV in causing respiratory infections among children in Ghana. Active surveillance of common respiratory viruses in healthcare facilities could enhance the management of viral respiratory infection cases in the paediatric population in Ghana."

A significant contributor to this resurgence could be drug resistance, particularly the emergence of partial resistance to artemisinin (ArtR) in Ethiopia and other regions of Eastern Africa. This situation highlights the necessity for genomic surveillance to monitor relevant drug resistance markers. This study reports sentinel site-based genomic surveillance results for P. falciparum antimalarial drug resistance mutations. From 2019 to 2022, dried blood spots (DBS) were collected from febrile outpatients [&ge;]1 year of age with microscopically confirmed falciparum malaria at 12 sentinel sites across 5 regions. Molecular inversion probe (MIP) sequencing targeted mutations associated with artemisinin and partner drug resistance, including k13, mdr1, crt, dhfr, and dhps genes, along with genome-wide markers to assess the complexity of infection (COI) and parasite relatedness. A total of 1,199 falciparum-positive patients were assessed, with a median age of 20 years (IQR: 14-30) and including 463 (38.6%) females. The WHO-validated K13 R622I mutation had a high but regionally variable prevalence (15.7%, range 0-58.8%). The validated K13 A675V mutation was detected for the first time in Ethiopia in the Gambella Region (4.5%), as well as P441L and P574L mutations were detected at low frequencies in Southern and Oromia Regions, respectively. Several partner drug resistance markers were identified, with mutations in MDR1(184F), DHPS, DHFR, and CRT nearly fixed across the country. Most samples (87.2%) were monogenic infections (COI=1) and showed high genetic relatedness, particularly within the health facilities. Principal component analysis revealed regional clustering of parasites, particularly in Gambella. The prevalence of K13 R622I across the country and the presence of multiple additional ArtR markers emphasizes the urgent need for rigorous monitoring of artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) efficacy to detect partner drug resistance and ACT failure early and its impact on malaria resurgence in Ethiopia."

MethodsTo identify all SSA NTD care pathways, we conducted a systematic search of six scientific databases from inception to 18 February 2023. All studies were required to include care pathways for NTDs, defined at minimum as having both NTD diagnosis and treatment or referral to treatment for care continuity. Using an iterative approach to establish an understanding of care pathways relevant for NTDs, concept development drew from data extraction of variables relating to study characteristics; approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and referrals as pathway components; barriers to care and strategies for their resolution; and ethical challenges.  FindingsSearches returned 2178 studies where after de-duplication and eligibility screening, 164 were systematically reviewed. Medical referrals were used to support care continuity in 62.2% (102/164) of studies, and community health workers played roles in patient care in 22.6% (37/164) of studies. Only 6.7% (11/164) of studies explicitly mapped care pathways, none of which were for NTDs where preventive chemotherapy is the primary management strategy. The majority of studies (82.9%; 136/164) presented unmapped care pathways, which were primarily biomedical research studies that provided diagnosis and/or treatment of NTD patients (66.9%; 91/136). Of biomedical research studies, 36.3% (33/91) described strategies to support continuity of care. While there is no singular care pathway for all NTDs in SSA, we proposed a conceptual framework relevant for implementation of biomedical research.  InterpretationFurther research is needed on morbidity management of NTDs typically addressed through mass drug administration in sub-Saharan Africa. To conduct this research, there is a need for guidance on how research sponsors should collaborate with local health systems to enable continuity of care in low-income, NTD-endemic settings.  Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSProviding continuity of care for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in the low-income settings where NTDs are endemic is challenging due to a variety of factors, particularly for chronic NTDs requiring morbidity management.  What this study addsAll NTDs require patient care, yet NTDs are unjustifiably divided into morbidity management NTDs and preventive chemotherapy NTDs. Further research on morbidity management is needed on NTDs typically managed through mass drug administration of preventive chemotherapies. We show that implementation of biomedical research on NTDs creates distinct care pathways that connect research participants with local health systems for continuity of care. These pathways provide a conceptual framework to understand care continuity during biomedical research as a practical ethical issue that merits further exploration, and illuminates how biomedical research studies might support care continuity for NTD patients such as through provision of transport, collaboration with community health workers, or structural support to local health system service providers.  How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis research opens avenues to create tools to assist researchers in providing care in resource-constrained settings. Researchers should consider care pathways for NTDs as a tool to understand local contexts of health seeking and care delivery prior to research implementation. Through these pathways, researchers can understand potential gaps in care continuity during research implementation, and determine what support may be required to address these gaps and facilitate research activities in low-income settings."

This study aimed to estimate the extent to which genetic pathways that are direct (via child genotype) and indirect (e.g., via parental phenotype) explain the well-established association between parent and child emotional problems. We leveraged data from seven European cohort studies with a combined population of Ntrios=15,475. Polygenic scores were calculated for parental and offspring neuroticism, as it represents a dispositional trait underlying emotional problems. Emotional problems in offspring were measured using validated scales across various developmental stages from early childhood to adulthood. We used neuroticism polygenic scores within a structural equation modelling framework to distinguish between direct genetic pathways from parental genotype to offspring outcome (acting through offspring genotype), and indirect genetic pathways (acting through parental phenotype and associated environment). Standard errors for direct genetic, indirect genetic and total effects were bootstrapped and meta-analyses pooled effect estimates at three developmental stages (childhood: 3-4 years, adolescence: 11-13 years, adulthood: 18+ years). We found evidence suggesting an indirect genetic pathway between mothers and child emotional problems during early childhood (pooled estimate, mean difference in standardised child emotional problems score per 1SD increase in maternal PGS for neuroticism=0.04, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07). This association attenuated over child development, while direct genetic pathways strengthened. High attrition rates, measurement error and low variance explained by polygenic scores may have altered precision of the estimates, influencing the interpretation of the results. However, we provide the first multi-cohort study to provide evidence for an indirect genetic pathway from maternal neuroticism to early child emotional problems. This suggests that there are likely processes other than direct genetic pathways involved in the intergenerational transmission of emotional problems, highlighting the importance of timely support to prevent and reduce emotional issues in mothers as a preventative strategy for emotional difficulties."

The Camden Study was originally initiated to examine nutritional status, growth, and birth outcomes in adolescent pregnancies and expanded to study dietary and molecular predictors of pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in young women.  MethodsFrom 1985-2006, 4765 pregnant participants aged 12 years and older were recruited from Camden, NJ, one of the poorest cities in the U.S. The cohort reflects a population under-represented in perinatal cohort studies (45% Hispanic, 38% non-Hispanic Black, 17% White participants; 98% using Medicaid in pregnancy). Study visits, including questionnaires, dietary assessments, and biospecimen collection, occurred in early and late pregnancy as well as at delivery. Medical records were abstracted, and a subset of mothers and infants participated in a six-week postpartum visit.  ResultsOver the last five decades, the Camden Study has provided data toward the publication of numerous peer-reviewed papers. Results show that adolescent linear growth in pregnancy is associated with smaller birth size, possibly due to impaired hemodynamics. In the context of preterm birth and other perinatal outcomes, analyses of nutritional data have demonstrated the importance of micronutrients (e.g., folate, iron, zinc), as well as glucose/insulin dynamics and prenatal supplement use. More recent analyses have begun to unpack the biochemical pathways in pregnancy that may be shaped by race as an indicator for systemic racism.  ConclusionsThe Camden Study data and biorepositories are well-positioned to support future research aimed at better understanding perinatal health in under-represented women and infants. Linkages to subsequent health and administrative records and the potential for recontacting participants over 18-39 years after initial participation may provide key insights into the trajectories of maternal and child health across the life course."

This study assesses the prevalence, intensity, and associated risk factors of STH following five rounds of albendazole-based PC in three implementation units (IUs) in Ondo State, Nigeria.  MethodologyFresh stool samples were collected from 2,093 children aged 5-14 years across 45 systematically selected schools in three IUs: Ese-Odo, Irele, and Ile-Oluji. The samples were analyzed using the Kato-Katz technique. Additionally, standardized questionnaires were administered to gather data on demographics and access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) resources. Data analysis was conducted using R software version 4.3.2, with a 95% confidence interval.  Principal Findings/ConclusionsThe parasitological data indicated a significant decline in the aggregated prevalence of STH across the three IUs. In Ese-Odo, the prevalence decreased to 25.8% (95% CI: 23.0-29.0) from 39% at baseline (d = -34%, p = 0.00). In Irele, prevalence dropped to 9.7% (95% CI: 7.6-12.0) from 51.3% at baseline (d = -81%, p = 0.00), and in Ile-Oluji, prevalence was reduced to 6.4% (95% CI: 4.6-8.7) from 23% at baseline (d = -72.2%, p = 0.00). The most prevalent STH species was Ascaris lumbricoides, with infection rates of 25.5%, 9.4%, and 6.4% in Ese-Odo, Irele, and Ile-Oluji, respectively, followed by Trichuris trichiura in Ese-Odo (2.7%) and Irele (0.4%), while hookworm infections were detected only in Irele (0.7%). The majority of infections were of low intensity in Ese-Odo (91.0%), Irele (96.8%), and Ile-Oluji (100%). Access to improved sanitation (17.7%, 54.9%, and 58.2%, p < 0.05), improved water sources (24.5%, 66.1%, and 69.8%, p < 0.05), and handwashing facilities (9.0%, 39.6%, and 25.4%) was suboptimal across Ese-Odo, Irele, and Ile-Oluji, respectively. Open defecation rates were high in Ese-Odo (54.2%), Irele (36.3%), and Ile-Oluji (34.3%). In Ese-Odo, significant risk factors for STH infection included the use of hand-pump boreholes (AOR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.23-4.88, p = 0.01), unprotected dug wells (AOR: 3.25, 95% CI: 0.96-11.36, p = 0.06), ventilated improved pit latrines (AOR: 3.95, 95% CI: 1.13-16.1, p = 0.04), pit latrines without a slab (AOR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.27-3.8, p = 0.01), and failure to use soap after defecation, both when soap was available (AOR: 12.09, 95% CI: 1.86-112.97, p = 0.01) and when soap was unavailable (AOR: 8.19, 95% CI: 1.73-76.65, p = 0.04). In Irele, access to protected dug wells was marginally significant (AOR: 1.79, 95% CI: 0.96-3.21, p = 0.06), while in Ile-Oluji, access to river water emerged as a significant risk factor (AOR: 7.97, 95% CI: 1.81-58.58, p = 0.02). The use of rainwater was found to be protective across all three IUs. These findings demonstrate significant progress in reducing STH prevalence across the three IUs following PC interventions. However, the data underscore the need for enhanced efforts to improve access to and use of WASH facilities to achieve STH elimination.  Authors SummaryThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends reducing soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) prevalence to below 20% and moderate-to-heavy infections to less than 2% in treated areas to achieve elimination targets. Endemic countries, including Nigeria, have implemented mass albendazole administration to at-risk populations to meet these goals. After a decade of such interventions in Nigeria, reassessing the infection status is essential for determining whether to adjust or discontinue the program. This study analyzed stool samples from 2,093 children across three implementation units (IUs) in Ondo State. The results indicated significant reductions in STH prevalence to below 20% in two of the three IUs, with no heavy infections reported in any IU. While these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the PC interventions, the study also identified poor access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) resources, highlighting the need for improvements in these areas to sustain progress and prevent infection resurgence."

MethodsMEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles from January 1, 2019 to February 9, 2024. Studies reporting effectiveness data from at least two doses of mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccination in adults with medical conditions at high risk of developing severe COVID-19 according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were included. Outcomes of interest were SARS-CoV-2 infection (overall, symptomatic, and severe), hospitalization due to COVID-19, and death due to COVID-19. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with random effects models. Subgroup analyses by specific medical conditions, number of vaccinations, age, and SARS-CoV-2 variant were conducted. Heterogeneity between studies was estimated with chi-square testing. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluations framework.  ResultsSixty-five observational studies capturing the original/ancestral-containing primary series to Omicron-containing bivalent original-BA4-5 vaccinations were included in the meta-analysis. mRNA-1273 was associated with significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79-0.92]; I2=92.5%), symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.65-0.86]; I2=62.3%), severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.78-0.89]; I2=38.0%), hospitalization due to COVID-19 (RR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82-0.94]; I2=38.7%), and death due to COVID-19 (RR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.76-0.93]; I2=1.3%) than BNT162b2. Findings were generally consistent across subgroups. Evidence certainty was low or very low because sufficiently powered randomized controlled trials are impractical in this heterogeneous population.  ConclusionMeta-analysis of 65 observational studies showed that vaccination with mRNA-1273 was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19-related hospitalization and death than BNT162b2 in patients with medical conditions at high risk of severe COVID-19."

In this updated systematic review, we evaluate new evidence since our 2019 systematic review on the effect of outdoor air pollution exposure on childhood and adolescent brain structure and function as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  MethodsUsing PubMed and Web of Science, we conducted an updated literature search and systematic review of articles published through March 2024, using key terms for air pollution and functional and/or structural MRI. Two raters independently screened all articles using Covidence and implemented the risk of bias instrument for systematic reviews informing the World Health Organization Global Air Quality Guidelines.  ResultsWe identified 222 relevant papers, and 14 new studies met our inclusion criteria. Including six studies from our 2019 review, the 20 publications to date include study populations from the United States, Netherlands, Spain, and United Kingdom. Studies investigated exposure periods spanning pregnancy through early adolescence, and estimated air pollutant exposure levels via personal monitoring, geospatial residential estimates, or school courtyard monitors. Brain MRI occurred when children were on average 6-14.7 years old; however, one study assessed newborns. Several MRI modalities were leveraged, including structural morphology, diffusion tensor imaging, restriction spectrum imaging, arterial spin labeling, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as resting-state and task-based functional MRI. Air pollutants were associated with widespread brain differences, although the magnitude and direction of findings are largely inconsistent, making it difficult to draw strong conclusions.  ConclusionPrenatal and childhood exposure to outdoor air pollution is associated with structural and functional brain variations. Compared to our initial 2019 review, publications doubled--an increase that testifies to the importance of this public health issue. Further research is needed to clarify the effects of developmental timing, along with the downstream implications of outdoor air pollution exposure on childrens cognitive and mental health.

ObjectiveExamine the multivariate association between clinical trial knowledge and participation with past-year health technology use and digital health engagement with medical providers.  DesignCross-sectional data from a federal surveillance system.  ParticipantsA total of 3,865 US adult respondents from the Health Information National Trends Survey 5, Cycle 4 conducted in 2020.  Main MeasuresThe two outcomes were clinical trial knowledge (no knowledge, a little knowledge, a lot of knowledge) and participation (never invited, invited did not participate, invited and participated). There were four binary indicators of health technology use for the following purposes in the past year: searching for health or medical information, communicating with a doctors office, looking up medical test results, and making medical appointments. There were four binary indicators of digital health engagement in the past year: sharing health information on social media, participating in a health forum or support group, watching health-related videos on YouTube, and awareness of ClinicalTrials.gov.  Key ResultsSurvey-weighted multivariate regression models demonstrated that awareness of ClinicalTrials.gov had the largest associations with clinical trial knowledge and participation. Digital technology use to engage with medical providers and electronic health records was associated with clinical participation, although the vast majority of respondents had never been invited.  ConclusionsFindings from this study can inform the design of large-scale digital health campaigns and quality improvement programs focused on increasing clinical trial participation."

However, the extent of contraception use among this group is underexplored in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine the prevalence of modern contraception use among persons with disabilities in LMICs and identify the key determinants.  MethodsIn June 2024, we conducted a systematic search across six databases to identify studies on disability and modern contraception in LMICs. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of modern contraception use and its determinants among persons with disabilities. Summary estimates were calculated using fixed or random-effects meta-analysis, depending on the level of heterogeneity.  ResultsA total of 19 studies were identified, with 11 included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of modern contraception use among persons with disabilities was 31.4% (95% CI: 26.5, 36.2), with significant heterogeneity across respondent characteristics. Five factors were significantly associated with higher contraception use: age over 25 years, having some level of education, being in a higher wealth quintile, adequate knowledge of family planning, and being in a formal marital relationship.  ConclusionThis study reveals a significantly lower prevalence of modern contraception use among persons with disabilities in LMICs. Improving access to education, addressing social norms, and strengthening healthcare systems may contribute to increase contraception access and uptake among persons with disabilities in LMICs."

In early 2020 most countries implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 NPIs disrupted the transmission of RSV on a global scale, and many locations did not experience widespread re-circulation until late 2020 or 2021. Here, we use a mechanistic transmission model informed by cellphone mobility data to determine which aspects of population behavior had the greatest influence on post-pandemic RSV rebound in Seattle, Washington.  MethodsWe used aggregated mobile device location data to characterize within-city mixing, visitor in-flows, and foot traffic to points of interest in Seattle. We fit an age-structured epidemiological model to data on weekly RSV hospitalizations, allowing for reductions in transmission due to declines in mobility during the pandemic. We compared model fits to observed data to assess which mobility behaviors best capture RSV dynamics during the first two post-pandemic waves in Seattle.  ResultsIn Seattle, COVID-19 NPIs perturbed RSV seasonality from 2020 to 2022. Seattle experienced a small out-of-season outbreak in Summer 2021 and an atypically large and early wave in Fall 2022. RSV transmission models incorporating mobility network connectivity (measured as the average shortest path length between Seattle neighborhoods) or the inflow of visitors from outside of Seattle best captured the timing and magnitude of the first two post-pandemic waves. Models including foot traffic to schools or child daycares or within-neighborhood movement produced poor fits to observed data.  ConclusionsOur results suggest that case importations from other regions and local spread between neighborhoods had the greatest influence on the timing of RSV reemergence in Seattle. These findings contribute to the understanding of behavioral factors underlying RSV epidemic spread and can inform the timing of preventative measures, such as the administration of immunoprophylaxis."

These findings demonstrate that mpox case investigations and community messaging campaigns should include considerations for non-sexual contact-mediated transmission of Clade Ib that includes children <15 years."

As COVID-19 remains a threat, it is imperative to improve current forecasting approaches by incorporating reliable data and alternative forecasting targets to better inform decision-makers.  Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has emerged as a viable method to track COVID-19 transmission, offering a more reliable metric than reported cases for forecasting critical outcomes like hospitalizations. Recognizing the natural alignment of wastewater systems with city structures, ideal for leveraging WBE data, this study introduces a multi-city, wastewater-based forecasting model to categorically predict COVID-19 hospitalizations.  Using hospitalization and COVID-19 wastewater data for six US cities, accompanied by other epidemiological variables, we develop a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to generate two categorization types. The Hospitalization Capacity Risk Categorization (HCR) predicts the burden on the healthcare system based on the number of available hospital beds in a city. The Hospitalization Rate Trend (HRT) Categorization predicts the trajectory of this burden based on the growth rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Using these categorical thresholds, we create probabilistic forecasts to retrospectively predict the risk and trend category of six cities over a 20-month period for 1, 2, and 3 week forecasting windows.  We also propose a new methodology to measure forecasting model performance at change points, or time periods where sudden changes in outbreak dynamics occurred. We also explore the influence of wastewater as a predictor for hospitalizations, showing its inclusion positively impacts the models performance. With this categorical forecasting study, we are able to predict hospital capacity risk and disease trends in a novel and useful way, giving city decision-makers a new tool to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations."

We aimed to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in predicting the Nugent score, with the goal of improving diagnostic consistency and accuracy. A total of 1,510 vaginal images collected from a hospital in Japan between 2021 and 2023 were assessed. Each image was annotated by laboratory technicians into one of four categories based on the Nugent score--normal vaginal flora, absence of vaginal flora, altered vaginal flora, or bacterial vaginosis. Deep learning models were developed to predict these categories, and their performance was evaluated by comparing the predicted scores with technician annotations. A high magnification model was further optimized and evaluated using an independent test set of 106 images to assess its performance relative to that of the technicians. The deep learning models demonstrated an accuracy of 84% at low magnification and 89% at high magnification in predicting the Nugent score categories. After optimization, the high magnification model achieved 94% accuracy, surpassing the average 92% accuracy of the technicians. The agreement between deep learning model predictions and technician annotations was 92% for normal vaginal flora, 100% for absence of vaginal flora, 91% for altered vaginal flora, and 100% for bacterial vaginosis. The deep learning models demonstrated accuracy comparable to that of laboratory technicians, which indicates their potential utility in improving the diagnostic accuracy of bacterial vaginosis.  IMPORTANCEBacterial vaginosis is a global health issue affecting women, causing symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge and discomfort. The Nugent score is the standard method for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis and is based on manual interpretation of Gram-stained vaginal smears. However, this method relies on the skill and experience of trained professionals, leading to variability in results and challenges in facilities with limited access to such experts. This poses significant challenges for settings with limited access to experienced technicians. The deep learning models developed in this study predict the Nugent score with high accuracy; thus, they can be used to standardize the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, reduce observer variability, and enable reliable diagnosis even in settings without experienced personnel. Although larger scale validation is needed, our results suggest that deep learning models may represent a new approach for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis."

We demonstrate that the CandyCollect device can be coupled with a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) kit designed for Group A Streptococcus (GAS). Through in vitro experiments with pooled saliva spiked with Streptococcus pyogenes we tested various reagents and elution volumes to optimize the RADT readout from CandyCollect device samples. The resulting optimized protocol uses the kit-provided reagents and lateral flow assay (LFA) while replacing the kits pharyngeal swab with the CandyCollect device, reducing the elution solution volume, and substituting the tube used for elution to accommodate the CandyCollect device. Positive test results were detected by eye with bacterial concentrations as low as the manufacturers ""minimal detection limit"" - 1.5x105 CFU/mL. LFA strips were also scanned and quantified with image analysis software to determine the signal-to-baseline ratio (SBR) and categorize positive test results without human bias. We tested our optimized protocol for integrating CandyCollect and RADT using CandyCollect clinical samples from pediatric patients (n=6) who were previously diagnosed with GAS pharyngitis via pharyngeal swabs tested with RADT as part of their clinical care. The LFA results of these CandyCollect devices and interspersed negative controls were determined by independent observers, with positive results obtained in four of the six participants on at least one LFA replicate. Taken together, our results show that CandyCollect devices from children with GAS pharyngitis can be tested using LFA rapid tests.

We conducted a systematic review of 311 published papers that included a mechanistic, population-level model of co-circulating human pathogens. We identified the types of pathogens represented in this literature, techniques used, and motivations for conducting these studies. We also created a complexity index to quantify the degree to which co-circulating pathogen models diverged from single-pathogen models. We found that the emergence of new pathogens, such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2, precipitated modeling activity of the emerging pathogen with established pathogens. Pathogen characteristics also tended to drive modeling activity; for example, HIV suppresses the immune response, eliciting interesting dynamics when it is modeled with other pathogens. The motivations driving these studies were varied but could be divided into two major categories: exploration of dynamics and evaluation of interventions. Finally, we found that model complexity quickly increases as additional pathogens are added. Future potential avenues of research we identified include investigating the effects of misdiagnosis of clinically similar co-circulating pathogens and characterizing the impacts of one pathogen on public health resources available to curtail the spread of other pathogens."

Fully automated surveillance of hospital-onset bacteraemia and fungaemia (HOB) may facilitate hospital-wide surveillance.  AimTo develop an algorithm and minimal dataset (MDS) required for automated surveillance of HOB and apply it to real-life routine data in four European hospitals.  MethodsThrough consensus discussion a HOB definition with MDS suitable for automated surveillance was developed and applied in a retrospective multicentre observational study including all admitted adult patients (2018-2022). HOB was defined as a positive blood culture with a recognised pathogen two or more days after hospital admission. For common commensals, two blood cultures with the same commensal within two days were required. Annual HOB rates were calculated per 1,000 patient days for the hospital and for intensive care units (ICU) and non-ICU.  ResultsHOB rates were comparable between the four hospitals (1.0 to 2.2 per 1,000 patient days). HOB rates were substantially higher in ICU than non-ICU across the four hospitals, and HOB with common commensals accounted for 14.8-28.2% of all HOB. HOB rates per 1,000 patient days were rather consistent over time, but were higher in 2020 and 2021. HOB caused by Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 8.4-16.0% of all HOB.  ConclusionAutomated HOB surveillance using a common definition was feasible and reproducible across four European hospitals. Future studies should investigate clinical relevance and preventability of HOB, and focus on strategies to make the automated HOB metric an actionable infection control tool."

We integrated these findings into an early warning system framework able to predict dengue outbreaks up to 2 months ahead. While a climate-informed model improved predictive power by 54% compared to a seasonal baseline, including additional serotype information increased predictive performance to 60%, helping to explain interannual variation.

MethodsWe studied 532 participants of the PREDIMED-Plus trial, a multicenter randomized trial in overweight and obese adults with metabolic syndrome. At baseline, 3 and 5 years after randomization, participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography and provided blood for serum biomarker measurements [propeptide of procollagen type I (PICP), high-sensitivity (hs) troponin T (hsTnT), hs C-reactive protein (hsCRP), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and N-terminal propeptide of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)]. Outcomes of interest included LA peak systolic longitudinal strain (LA PSLS), LA volume index (LAVi), LA function index (LAFi), and LA stiffness index (LASi). We performed cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses to evaluate relationships between log-transformed biomarkers and echocardiographic measurements using multiple linear regression and mixed models.  ResultsThe participants in this analysis had a mean age of 65.0 (SD 4.8) years, and 40% were females. At baseline, increased NT-proBNP and hsTnT were associated with larger LAVi and worse LA function as measured by the LAFi, LASi, and LA PSLS. Longitudinally, higher NT-proBNP, but not higher hsTnT, was associated with increased LAVi and worsening LA function. Over 5 years, 1 unit increase in log(NT-proBNP) was associated with steeper decline in LA PSLS (-0.19%, 95% CI -0.35%, -0.02%) and greater increase in LAVi (0.28 mL/m2, 95% CI 0.10, 0.45) each year.

We also investigate the potential mediating role of hormone therapy (HT) in early postmenopause (within 5 years of menopause onset or surgery) in these relationships. Using data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA), we employ sequence and cluster analysis, followed by mediation analysis. Our findings indicate that women with early menopause, compared to those who undergo menopause at 45 or older, are less likely to have flexible working arrangements (part-time work or self-employment) compared to full-time work during this sensitive period. However, they are equally likely to exit the labour market as to work full-time, indicating distinct experiences. Surgical menopause, compared to natural menopause, is associated with an increased risk of labour market exit, particularly for women aged 45 or older at the time of surgery, potentially due to higher comorbidities and increased age-related precarity. HT use appears to mitigate the risk of labour market exit for women with both early and surgical menopause, although other factors (e.g., health) may play a more significant role in this transition out of work. We advocate for further research on the impact of early and surgical menopause on womens labour market circumstances and for workplace policies that consider the diverse experiences of women with early and surgical menopause, including their increased risk of chronic conditions."

Moreover, while both health conditions co-occurring with infertility and genetic factors operating upstream have been suggested to influence the association between infertility and child outcomes, their roles and potential impact on observed associations remain unclear.  OBJECTIVEThe objectives of this study are to investigate the relationship between female infertility and autism in the child, differentiating it from the effects of male and the couple infertility; consider the role of various maternal and birth factors in the association; and examine the effects of shared familial confounders on the association.  DESIGN SETTING AND PARTICIPANTSDanish population-based cohort study, including all singleton live births in Denmark 1998-2015, their parents and parents siblings. The cohort was followed up until December 31, 2016.  EXPOSURESThe exposure was a history of female infertility in the mother and the mothers sister. We examined four definitions of female infertility based on the ICD-10 codes derived from the Danish National Patient Register - any female infertility; specified female infertility; female exclusive infertility; and female or male infertility.  MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURESThe outcome was diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register or the national patient register. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to estimate the associations between female infertility and autism, accounting for childs sex, year of birth, maternal age, education level, chronic comorbidities, and pregnancy and birth complications. The effects of shared familial factors on the association were analyzed using exposure information from the childs maternal aunt.  RESULTSThe cohort included 1,131,899 mother-child pairs, among which 18,374 children with ASD diagnosis. History of female infertility in the mother (all definitions) was significantly associated with autism in the child, with the association remaining robust after adjustment for covariates (HRadj=1.14 (95% CI, 1.03-1.26) for specified infertility). The diagnosis of infertility in a childs maternal aunt was also significantly linked to the childs autism risk, even after adjustment for maternal infertility (HRadj=1.10 (95% CI, 1.00-1.20).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEin This population-based birth cohort study, we found a slightly higher risk of autism in children born to mothers with a history of infertility, with the association remaining consistent across various definitions of female infertility and robust to adjustments for demographic, child, and maternal factors. The study suggests for the first time that shared familial factors, possibly both genetic and non-genetic, could be influencing both female infertility and the risk of autism in children, indicating a need for further investigation into these familial effects."

Therefore, climate change is expected to profoundly affect malaria epidemiology in its transmission, spatiotemporal distribution and consequent disease burden. However, malaria transmission is also complicated by other factors (e.g. urbanisation, economics, genetics, drug resistance) which together constitute a highly complex, dynamical system, where the influence of any single factor is highly uncertain.  In this study, we therefore aim to re-evaluate the evidence underlying the widespread belief that climate change will increase worldwide malaria transmission. We firstly review the different types of studies that have contributed to this evidence-base: i) studies that project changes in transmission due to inferred relationships between environmental and mosquito entomology; ii) studies that focus on either mechanistic transmission or time series models to estimate the effects of malaria control strategies on prevalence, and iii) regression-based studies that look for associations between environmental variables and malaria prevalence. We then employ a simple statistical model to show that environmental variables alone do not account for the observed spatiotemporal variation in malaria prevalence.  Our review raises several concerns about the robustness of the analyses used for advocacy around climate change and malaria. We find that, while climate changes effect on malaria is highly plausible, empirical evidence is much less certain. Future research on climate change and malaria must become integrated into malaria control programs, and understood in context as one factor among many affecting malaria. Our work outlines gaps in modelling that we believe are priorities for future research."

This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the associations between statin use and muscle-related phenotypes including sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and musculoskeletal pain symptoms among adults with indications for statin use for secondary prevention (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia).  MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 22,549 patients aged [&ge;]20 years with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hyperlipidemia. Weighted generalized linear regression analysis and propensity score matching methods were used to estimate the associations between the use of statins or other lipid-lowering agents and skeletal muscle-related phenotypes. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was additionally used to verify the causal relationship between statin use and skeletal muscle-related phenotypes.  ResultsThe weighted mean age was 59 years, 50.3% were male, and 37.6% (n=8,481) received statin treatment. In the unadjusted model, compared with adults without any lipid-lowering drugs, statin use was associated with a higher likelihood of sarcopenia (appendicular skeletal muscle mass [ASM]/Body mass index [BMI] OR 1.35 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.62, p < 0.001), ASM/weight [Wt] OR 1.86 (95%CI 1.62 to 2.13, p < 0.001), max HGS {beta} -3.01 (95% CI -3.97 to -2.06, p < 0.001), relative HGS {beta} -0.23 (95% CI -0.30 to -0.17, p < 0.001) and combined HGS {beta} -5.90 (95% CI -7.86 to -3.93, p < 0.001)), sarcopenic obesity (ASM/height squared [Ht2] and body fat percentage definition [OR 1.36 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.63, p < 0.001]). After multivariable adjustment or propensity score match, the independent associations of statin use with sarcopenia, sarcopenic obesity, HGS, LDH, and musculoskeletal pain became nonsignificant. Stepwise regression suggested that age was the predominant confounding factor for the associations. MR analysis also revealed no significant causality between statin use and skeletal muscle-related phenotypes.  ConclusionsOur epidemiological and MR analyses did not support the causality between statin use and skeletal muscle-related phenotypes. A higher likelihood of skeletal muscle-related adverse phenotypes in statin users may be attributed to age. Future studies should further explore the biological factors that may affect statin-related muscle phenotypes to provide evidence for the safety of statins."

However, they are unsuitable to chronic disease where past and present states interplay and affect future states, and the estimated transition probabilities are time-specific which are not straightforward for public health interpretation. We have proposed a multi-state non-Markov framework that splits disease states into substates conditioning on past states. As the substates track past states and indicate multimorbidity, the estimated transition rates can be used to derive two summary estimates: Disease path which shows path of state transition, and multimorbidity-adjusted life year (MALY) which represents the adjusted life year in full health. In this paper, we showed the derivation of the two summary estimates and applied them to characterize the course of heart disease using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC) study. The course of heart disease was modeled in five states, namely, healthy, at metabolic risk, coronary heart disease (CHD), heart failure, and mortality. In this mid- to old-age population, the estimated MALY was 24.13 (95% CI: 16.55, 32.06) years. For healthy participants at baseline, the most likely disease paths were: ""Healthy [-&gt;] at metabolic risk [-&gt;] mortality"" (37%), ""Healthy [-&gt;] mortality"" (21%), ""Healthy [-&gt;] at metabolic risk [-&gt;] heart failure [-&gt;] mortality"" (19%), and ""Healthy [-&gt;] at metabolic risk [-&gt;] CHD [-&gt;] mortality"" (8%). The MALY was higher among women than men and higher among Whites than Blacks. The distribution of disease path was similar across sex and race subgroups. In summary, MALY and disease path characterize the disease course in a summary manner and have potential use in chronic disease prevention."

MethodsA cohort of 12,435 unrelated individuals of European ancestry with T2D was extracted from the UK Biobank data linked to primary care records. Latent class growth mixture modelling was applied to identify classes with similar HbA1c trajectories over the 10-years following T2D diagnosis. We tested for associations of HbA1c class membership with sociodemographic factors, biomarkers, polygenic scores, and T2D-related outcomes, using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models.  ResultsSix HbA1c trajectory classes were identified. The largest class (76.8%) maintained low and stable HbA1c levels over time. The other five classes demonstrated higher and more variable trajectories and included: two with parabolic shapes (starting low and distinguished by the height of their peaks), two with high initial HbA1c levels that declined over time (one rapidly, one slowly), and one class with a rapid increase in HbA1c five years after diagnosis. Younger age at T2D diagnosis, higher fasting glucose levels, higher random glucose levels, and higher body mass index polygenic score were associated with membership of these five classes. These classes were also more likely to be prescribed glucose-lowering medication at diagnosis and had fewer primary care visits in the month and year prior to diagnosis. Relative to the low and stable class, these five showed increased risks of T2D complications, including stroke (HR=1.55 [1.31-1.84]), kidney disease (HR=1.39 [1.27-1.53]), all-cause mortality (HR=1.36 [1.23-1.51]), and progression to combination therapy (HR=3.22 [3.04-3.41]) or insulin (HR=3.21 [2.89-3.55]).

We report that in 2023-2024, MPXV clade Ib genomes are diverging at a faster rate than clade IIb (2022), primarily due to an unusually high incidence of recombination. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ib strains have diverged into four lineages, and they have evolved into 14 subgroups based on nine tandem repeat (TR) polymorphisms. These findings confirms that TRs in MPXV Ib are mutating at a significantly higher frequency compared to the 2022 outbreak (clade IIb, 11 subgroups). Linkage disequilibrium analysis also identified 10 recombination clusters among all 4 lineages, with recombination incidence in Ib being twice as high as in IIb. This suggests that a higher rate of superinfection is contributing to ongoing recombination among populations infected with clade Ib. Prompt action is necessary to prevent the emergence of more lethal mpox strains."

This study examined the effectiveness of these policies to contribute to the ongoing discussions on proactive and pre-emptive interventions for similar future outbreaks.  A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods were used for the analysis. Data were drawn from multiple sources, including peer-reviewed and grey literature, and academic experts from Ghanaian universities. The data from the literature informed a questionnaire that was sent to independent academic experts to explore their opinions on whether the policies met their intended objectives. The experts opinions were collected on a 5-point Likert scale and from an open-ended question using an online data collection platform, Qualtrics. The data were evaluated using narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.  We identified and evaluated eight key COVID-19 policy responses in Ghana: (1) partial lockdown of epicentres; (2) COVID-19 public awareness campaigns; (3) ban on public gatherings; (4) COVID-19 vaccination; (5) border closures; (6) entry border COVID-19 screening; (7) incentives for healthcare workers (HCWs); and (8) the Ghana Alleviation and Revitalisation of Enterprises Support (GCARES).

This outbreak is still ongoing and expanding to other regions and countries. Here, we describe the epidemiological and genomic evolution of the outbreak from September 2023 to June 2024.  MethodsConsenting patients with mpox-like symptoms admitted to the Kamituga and the Kamanyola hospitals were recruited to the study. Samples from throat, lesions, breast milk and placenta were collected for PCR testing and sequencing. For the patients from Kamituga hospital, data on place of residence and possible exposures were collected by interviews. The location and numbers of employees were collected for all bars with sex workers. Where possible, exposures were linked to the genomic sequencing data for cluster analysis.  FindingsIn total, 670 (suspected) mpox cases were admitted to the Kamituga hospital. There were slightly more female than male cases (351/670 [52,4%] versus 319/670, [47,6%], and cases were reported from 17 different health areas. The majority of cases were reported in Mero (205/670 [30,6%]), followed by Kimbangu (115/670 [17,2%]), Kabukungu (105/670 [16,7%]), and Asuku (73/670 [10.9%]). During this period, 7 deaths occurred and 8 out of 14 women who were pregnant had fetal loss. Three healthcare workers acquired mpox infection when caring for patients. In depth case ascertainment showed that 83,4% of patients reported recent visits to bars for (professional) sexual interactions as a likely source of infection. Whole genome sequencing resulted in the generation of 58 genome sequences. Three main clusters characterized by specific mutations were identified and several miniclusters of 2 or more sequences with over two shared mutations. No clear link between sequence cluster, bar or health area was observed. The more recent sequences from Kamanyola were related to the sequences in Kamituga and confirmed to be Clade Ib. However, relatively long branches were observed and one of the sequences clustered with publicly released sequences from travelers in Kenya, Uganda, Sweden and Thailand, indicating more undocumented ongoing spread for cluster A than for the other clusters. Most observed mutations were APOBEC-3 related mutations indicative of ongoing human-to-human transmission.  InterpretationThese data suggests that the rapid transmission of monkeypox virus until June 2024 was mostly related to interactions with professional sex workers (PSW) within densely populated health areas. The expanding number of cases and the recent expansion to 29 other nearby health zones of South -Kivu as well as Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Kenya stresses the need for cross border surveillance and collaboration. Urgent enhanced response action is needed, including case finding, diagnostic capacity building, health education programmes focussing on sex workers, and possibly vaccination to limit further escalation and stop this outbreak."

It serves as a platform for implementing nested trials using the Trials within Cohorts (TwiCs) design to assess community-based chronic care interventions. Here, we present the cohorts sociodemographic and chronic disease risk factor profile, including self-reported HIV prevalence and hypertension and diabetes care cascades.  ParticipantsSince February 2023, Community Health Worker (CHWs) supported by a clinical decision support and data collection application, have enrolled inhabitants from 103 randomly selected rural villages in Butha-Buthe and Mokhotlong districts in North-East Lesotho. As of May 31, 2024, the cohort includes 5008 households with 14735 participants (55% female, median age 19 years). The cohorts socioeconomic status is low with an International Wealth Index of 26, a monthly household income of 42.4 USD and low levels of formal education. Among the 7917 adult participants, 42.5% are overweight or obese, with higher rates among women, and 33.1% smoke tobacco, with higher rates among men. Self-reported HIV prevalence is 15.1% with a 98.4% treatment rate. Hypertension prevalence is 17% with a 56% control rate and diabetes prevalence is 4% with a 39% control rate.  Findings to dateThe cohorts low socioeconomic status is linked to multiple health risks including insufficient access to clean energy, essential healthcare services, adequate sanitary facilities and secure food supply. Besides the expected high HIV prevalence, we found significant hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular risk factor prevalences. While treatment and control rates for diabetes and hypertension are higher than in similar settings, they remain below global targets.  Future plansOngoing cluster-randomized TwiCs, which will be completed in 2025, are assessing the effectiveness of community-based, CHW-led care interventions for diabetes and hypertension. CHWs will continue to closely monitor the cohort and integrate additional measurements such as HIV testing. This will provide further insights into the dynamics and interactions of chronic diseases and inform the development of future nested trials on innovative community-based prevention and care interventions.  RegistrationNCT05596773  Strengths and limitations- Comprehensive Data Collection: The ComBaCaL cohort offers comprehensive data on sociodemographics, chronic disease risk factors, and hypertension and diabetes care cascades within a large, representative sample of the rural population in Lesotho. - Community-Based Approach: Data is captured by local Community Health Workers residing in the study villages using a tailored clinical decision support and data collection application. This approach allows for continuous data collection, remote monitoring by study staff, and data verification, ensuring nearly complete village enrolment and high data quality. - Efficient study design: The cohort utilizes the Trials within Cohorts (TwiCs) design, which allows for the efficient implementation of multiple randomized nested trials to assess the effectiveness of innovative health interventions. - Reliance on self-reported data: Assessments other than hypertension and diabetes screening outcomes rely on self-reported data, which may have limited correlation with objective assessments. - Limitations in data scope: Clinical data on chronic conditions other than hypertension and diabetes remain limited and anthropometric and behavioural risk factor data for children has not yet been collected."

Understanding the prices at which their market can be sustained and which vaccination strategies may maximise impact and cost-effectiveness, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, can provide a valuable tool for vaccine development and investment decision-making at a national and global level. To address this evidence gap, we projected the health and economic impact of NGIVs in 186 countries and territories.  Methods and FindingsWe inferred current influenza transmission parameters from World Health Organization (WHO) FluNet data in regions de[fi]ned by their transmission dynamics, and projected thirty years of influenza epidemics, accounting for demographic changes. Vaccines considered included current seasonal vaccines, vaccines with increased efficacy, duration, and breadth of protection, and universal vaccines, de[fi]ned in line with the WHO Preferred Product Characteristics. We estimated cost-effectiveness of different vaccination scenarios using novel estimates of key health outcomes and costs.  NGIVs have the potential to substantially reduce influenza burden: compared to no vaccination, vaccinating 50% of children aged under 18 annually prevented 1.3 (95% uncertainty range (UR): 1.2-1.5) billion infections using current vaccines, 2.6 (95% UR: 2.4-2.9) billion infections using vaccines with improved efficacy or breadth, and 3.0 (95% UR: 2.7-3.3) billion infections using universal vaccines. In many countries, NGIVs were cost-effective at higher prices than typically paid for existing seasonal vaccines. However, cross-subsidy may be necessary for improved vaccines to be cost-effective in lower income countries.  This study is limited by the availability of accurate data on influenza incidence and influenza-associated health outcomes and costs. Furthermore, the model involves simplifying assumptions around vaccination coverage and administration, and does not account for societal costs or budget impact of NGIVs. How NGIVs will compare to the vaccine types considered in this model when developed is unknown. We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate key model parameters.  ConclusionsThis study highlights the considerable potential health and economic bene[fi]ts of NGIVs, but also the variation in cost-effectiveness between high-income and low- and middle-income countries. This work provides a framework for long-term global cost-effectiveness evaluations, and contributes to a full value of influenza vaccines assessment to inform recommendations by WHO, providing a pathway to developing NGIVs and rolling them out globally."

This study analyzed over 26,000 genomes and their associated metadata collected between January and October 2021 to explore the introduction and dispersal patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in Greater Houston, a major metropolitan area noted for its demographic diversity. We identified more than a thousand independent introduction events, resulting in clusters of varying sizes, with earlier clusters presenting larger sizes and posing greater control challenges. Characterization of the sources of these introductions showed that domestic origins were more significant than international ones. Further examination of locally circulating clusters across different subregions of Greater Houston revealed varied transmission dynamics. Notably, subregions that served as primary viral sources sustained the local epidemic effectively, evidenced by: (1) a smaller proportion of new cases driven by external viral importations, and (2) longer persistence times of circulating lineages. Overall, our high-resolution spatiotemporal reconstruction of the epidemic in Greater Houston enhances understanding of the heterogeneous transmission landscape, providing key insights into regional response strategies and public health planning.  Significance StatementThe growing recognition of genome sequencing as critical for outbreak response has led to a rapid increase in the availability of sequence data. In this context, we put forward an analytical workflow within the Bayesian phylodynamic framework to identify and trace imported SARS-CoV-2 clusters using large-scale genome datasets.

Early diagnosis of TB and identification of drug-resistance is of particular importance in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals, as delay of therapy and subsequent development of drug-resistant TB can be devastating due to compromised immune systems.  MethodologyWe conducted a cross-sectional evaluation study using presumptive M. tuberculosis positive clinical isolates at two urban sites in Malawi (Blantyre and Lilongwe) to assess the presence of mutant genes on first and second line TB drugs using Line Probe Assay (LPA) and the gold standard drug susceptibility test (DST)  ResultsFor the Lilongwe site, the incidence of MDR-TB by Line Probe Assay (LPA) was found to be 14.06% (95% CI: 8%-20%) whereas that for Rif mono-resistance was 6.25% (95% CI: 2%-10%). Contrastingly, MDR-TB by DST was 23.44% (95 CI:16% - 21%) while mono-resistance was 6.25% (95% CI:2% -10). There was a substantial agreement on the detection of MDR-TB (kappa statistic was 0.75 with 95% CI of 0.62-0.88). Blantyre site, at 9.5% confidence interval, the point estimate for MDR-TB was 0% while for INH mono-resistance TB was 3.3%.  ConclusionsThere is high incidence of MDR-TB among patients whose samples are sent to the Lilongwe site than previously thought. A short turnaround time to diagnosis, and the ability to simultaneously detect rifampicin and isoniazid resistance, makes LPA a reliable tool for the early detection of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis."

Effective monitoring of Leishmania-infected sand flies requires standardized tools for comparing their distribution and infection prevalence. Consistent quantitative PCR (qPCR) conditions and efficient DNA extraction protocols are crucial for reliable results over time and across regions. However, there is currently a lack of technical recommendations for Leishmania DNA detection, which needs to be addressed. This study aimed to compare various DNA extraction protocols and conduct a qPCR based External Quality Assessment (EQA) through a multicenter study involving nine reference laboratories.  Methodology/Principal findingsEQA samples were prepared using Leishmania infantum and L. major strains, at different concentration from 101 to 104 parasites/mL and distributed to participating centers. All centers, except one, detected all Leishmania concentrations, demonstrating diagnostic proficiency. The ability to detect low concentrations highlighted the robustness of the qPCR assay used, although Cq value variations suggested differences in sensitivity due to technical capabilities and/or extraction kit performances.  Reported comparative analysis of seven DNA extraction methods identified the EZ1 DSP Virus(R) Kit and QIAamp(R) DNA mini-kit as the most efficient, supporting their use for standardized protocols. The study also evaluated the impact of lyophilization and shipment conditions, finding no compromise in Leishmania detection, despite slight Cq value variations. In addition to EQA samples, experimentally infected sand fly have been included to mimic sample field condition. All centers detected positive samples, with variable Cq values, reflecting differences in individual infection load.  Conclusion and significanceOverall, the study underscores the importance of standardized protocols and continuous quality assurance to maintain high diagnostic validity, crucial for effective surveillance of leishmaniasis, especially in field settings with low infection densities. Continuous training and calibration are essential to ensure uniform diagnostic performance across laboratories, enhancing epidemiological surveillance and disease control strategies.  Author SummaryLeishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, transmitted by sand flies, and poses a major health risk in the Mediterranean region. Monitoring the spread of nfected sand flies is crucial for controlling the disease. This study focused on improving the methods used to detect Leishmania in sand flies by comparing different DNA extraction techniques and assessing the accuracy of these methods across nine reference laboratories. All centers, except one, efficiently detected all Leishmania concentrations, demonstrating proficiency in diagnostic protocols. Moreover, we found that two specific DNA extraction kits, the EZ1 DSP Virus(R) Kit and QIAamp(R) DNA mini-kit, were the most effective for Leishmania detection. We also tested how sample preparation and shipping conditions affected the results, ensuring that our methods would work in real-world settings. Even under these conditions, the detection methods proved reliable. This work helps to standardize the detection of Leishmania, making surveillance more accurate and consistent. Continuous training and calibration are essential to ensure uniform diagnostic performance across laboratories, enhancing epidemiological surveillance and disease control strategies"

Longitudinal studies exploring the link between DNA methylation clocks and cognitive decline have been constrained by limited sample sizes and a lack of diversity.  ObjectiveOur study aimed to investigate the longitudinal associations between DNA methylation clocks and incident cognitive impairment using a larger sample size encompassing a US nationally representative sample from the Health and Retirement Study.  MethodsWe measured DNA methylation age acceleration in 2016 by comparing the residuals of DNA methylation clocks, including GrimAge, against chronological age. Cognitive decline was determined by the change in Langa-Weir cognition status from 2016 to 2018. Using multivariable logistic regression, we evaluated the link between DNA methylation age acceleration and cognitive decline, adjusting for cell-type proportions, demographic, and health factors. We also conducted an inverse probability weighting analysis to address potential selection bias from varying loss-to-follow-up rates.  ResultsThe analytic sample (N=2,713) at baseline had an average of 68 years old, and during the two years of follow-up, 12% experienced cognitive decline. Participants who experienced cognitive decline during follow-up had higher baseline GrimAge (mean = 1.2 years) acceleration compared to those who maintained normal cognitive function (mean = -0.8 years, p < 0.001). A one-year increase in GrimAge acceleration was associated with 1.05 times higher adjusted and survey-weighted odds of cognitive decline during follow-up (95% CI: 1.01-1.10). This association was consistent after accounting for loss-to-follow-up (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04-1.11).  ConclusionOur study offers insights into DNA methylation age acceleration associated with cognitive decline, suggesting avenues for improved prevention, diagnosis, and treatment."

Yet, little empirical evidence exists to support this notion, and it remains largely an intuitive, though highly plausible hypothesis. Our interdisciplinary uses WES data to show evidence for underreporting of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of measurable and statistically significant associations between economic conditions and SARS-CoV-2 incidence and testing rates. We obtained geolocated, anonymised, laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load data and socio-demographic data for Gauteng Province, South Africa. We spatially located all data to create a single dataset for sewershed catchments served by two large wastewater treatment plants. We conducted epidemiological, persons infected and principal component analysis to explore the relationships between variables. Overall, we demonstrate the co-contributory influences of socio-economic indicators on access to SARS-CoV-2 testing and cumulative incidence, thus reflecting that apparent incidence rates mirror access to testing and socioeconomic considerations rather than true disease epidemiology. These analyses demonstrate how WES provides valuable information to contextualise and interpret laboratory-based epidemiological data. Whilst it is useful to have these associations established for SARS-CoV-2, the implications beyond SARS-CoV-2 are legion for two reasons, namely that biases inherent in clinical surveillance are broadly applicable across pathogens and all pathogens infecting humans will find their way into wastewater albeit in varying quantities. WES should be implemented to strengthen surveillance systems, especially where economic inequalities limit interpretability of conventional surveillance data."

The purpose of this study was to examine among those being children and adolescents at that time, the effect of place of residence, nutrition and self-reported health consequences of wartime experiences on current self-reported health 50 years later.  Material and methodsIn connection with the cardio-vascular screening study in Finnmark 1996/97 nine questions regarding health status and experiences during World War II were included in a questionnaire. Altogether 3.471 persons born between 1925 and 1944 responded to the questions: 64% response rate. The dependant variables in the analysis were current self-reported health.  ResultsIn a multivariate analysis those who reported reduction in health due to the war had a higher risk of having poor self-reported health at time of screening; OR=2.7 (95% confidence interval 2.1-3.5). Place of residence 1944/45 in Finnmark was a borderline significant risk factor, while lack of food was associated with reduced self-reported health.  ConclusionDespite the long period of time between World War II and the present screening, a relation between the experience from the war and having a poor self-evaluated health status today was found. The study indicates long-term health consequences of warfare on the civilian population, but due to the cross-sectional design further prospective studies are necessary."

Some of the commonly known teratogenic viruses include cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella, herpes simplex and varicella zoster (VZV) viruses. Most birth defects associated with these infections affect the central nervous system and sensory organs leading to symptoms that include mental retardation, hearing loss and blindness. The economic burden caused by congenital birth defects is high, as many affected children require special care, therapeutic and educational services. Despite the risk posed by teratogenic viruses during pregnancy, there is no national screening for active CMV, Rubella or VZV infection during pregnancy in Botswana and most African countries. Furthermore, data on the seroprevalence of these viruses among women of childbearing age is limited.  Methods and settingThis cross-section study used eighty-nine (89) residual plasma samples from Scottish Livingstone Hospital Laboratory in Molepolole-Botswana. Samples were from women between the ages 15-49 years. Samples were tested for antibodies against rubella, VZV and CMV using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.  ResultsOur results show a high seroprevalence of rubella IgG antibodies (97%), even though a small proportion (3%) of women are still susceptible. There was also a high seroprevalence of CMV IgG (100%) which was accompanied by an equally high CMV IgM of 98%. Seroprevalence of VZV IgG was low (63%) and 3% of the samples showed active VZV infection.  ConclusionsTeratogenic viruses are a concern in the population. This calls for preventative measures which include prompt screening and vaccination of susceptible eligible women to prevent congenital abnormalities in children."

Since metformin, the guideline-recommended first-line treatment, is contraindicated for severe chronic kidney disease, we examine variation in this treatment decision on two axes--across estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements from the patient and across preferences from the prescribing provider.  Study Design and SettingUsing a large insurance claims dataset, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who were newly initiated on a type 2 diabetes treatment (metformin versus a DPP-4 inhibitor or sulfonylurea). Three years of observation prior to treatment were required, and patients with type 1 or gestational diabetes or without eGFR results were excluded. To test whether the choice of treatment is significantly dependent on eGFR level, we performed a chi-squared test for association between eGFR level and treatment decision. 2) To test whether practice variation exists among providers that cannot be explained by treatment guidelines, we fitted restricted cubic spline models to predict treatment from patient age, eGFR, sex, history of heart failure, and treatment date. Then, we performed a generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) to assess whether a model that included provider-specific random effects is a better fit than a model without these random effects.  ResultsAmong 10,643 eligible patients, the choice of metformin versus a DPP-4 inhibitor or a sulfonylurea was significantly associated with eGFR level (p < 0.0001). Among the 2,271 patients seen by 173 providers with at least 10 patients in the cohort, a GLRT found significant variation exists across providers even after accounting for age, eGFR, sex, history of heart failure, and treatment date (p < 0.0001).  ConclusionOur study found significant variation in first-line type 2 diabetes treatments--some that can be explained by treatment guidelines and some that may be due to provider preferences. Further studies can help elucidate whether such variation across providers is appropriate. The data-driven approaches in our study can also be applied to other disease areas to characterize variation in real-world clinical practice and potential opportunities for improvement.

Real-time genomic surveillance using offers the potential to detect otherwise unidentified outbreaks. We initiated and evaluated the Enhanced Detection System for Healthcare-associated Transmission (EDS-HAT), a real-time genomic surveillance program for outbreak detection and mitigation.  MethodsThis study was conducted at UPMC Presbyterian Hospital from November 2021 to October 2023. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed weekly on healthcare-associated clinical bacterial isolates to identify otherwise undetected outbreaks. Interventions were implemented in real-time based on identified transmission. A clinical and economic impact analysis was conducted to estimate infections averted and net cost savings.  ResultsThere were 3,921 bacterial isolates from patient healthcare-associated infections that underwent WGS, of which 476 (12.1%) clustered into 172 outbreaks (size range 2-16 patients). Of the outbreak isolates, 292 (61.3%) had an identified epidemiological link. Among the outbreaks with interventions, 95.6% showed no further transmission on the intervened transmission route. The impact analysis estimated that, over the two-year period, 62 infections were averted, with gross cost savings of $1,011,146, and net savings of $695,706, which translates to a 3.2-fold return on investment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed EDS-HAT was cost-saving and more effective in 98% of simulations.  ConclusionReal-time genomic surveillance enabled the rapid detection and control of outbreaks in our hospital and resulted in economic benefits and improvement in patient safety. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating genomic surveillance into routine infection prevention practice, offering a paradigm shift in healthcare outbreak detection and control."

MethodsThis ecological study used Swedish registers to obtain national population data and cases of genital warts from 2006-2018 in men and women aged 15-44. We used Poisson models to evaluate GW incidence change after vaccination in reference to a pre-vaccination period, stratified by age and sex. As well as, to estimate incidence change of GW in birth cohorts eligible for different vaccination programs compared to a pre-vaccination cohort. Finally, we estimated GW cases averted in each vaccinated cohort.  ResultsThe incidence of GW decreased during periods following HPV vaccination. In 2016-2018, over a decade after vaccination availability, incidence decreased by 89% (95% CI 83-93), 73% (95% CI 71-75), 50% (95% CI 43-56) and 20% (95% CI 10-28) in women aged 15-19, 20-24, 25-29 and 30-34, respectively. A similar reduction was observable in men, although of lesser magnitude. We estimated 18,890 and 12,343 GW cases averted among vaccinated cohorts of women and men, respectively.  ConclusionsWe report on population-level decreases of GW incidence in women and men following increased vaccination coverage. Cohorts eligible for school-based vaccination recorded the largest decrease in GW incidence in Sweden to date. For the period under study, decreases among men could be attributed to herd effects."

We measured COVID-19 VE against laboratory-confirmed symptomatic infection in HCWs in the country of Georgia from January - June 2022, during a period of Omicron circulation.  MethodsWe conducted a cohort study of HCWs in six hospitals in Georgia. HCWs were enrolled in early 2021. Participants completed weekly symptom questionnaires. Symptomatic HCWs were tested by RT-PCR and/or rapid antigen test (RAT). Participants were also routinely tested, at varying frequencies during the study period, for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR or RAT, regardless of symptoms. Serology was collected quarterly throughout the study and tested by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We estimated absolute and relative VE of a first booster dose compared to a primary vaccine series as (1-hazard ratio)*100 using Cox proportional hazards models.  ResultsAmong 1253 HCWs, 141 (11%) received a primary vaccine series (PVS) and a first booster, 855 (68%) received PVS only, and 248 (20%) were unvaccinated. Most boosters were BNT162b2 (Comirnaty original monovalent) vaccine (90%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (Sinopharm) (9%). Most PVS were BNT162b2 vaccine (68%) and BIBP-CorV vaccine (24%). Absolute VE for a first booster was 40% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) -56 - 77) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, -9% (95% CI -104 - 42) at 30 - 59 days, and - 46% (95% CI -156 - 17) at [&ge;] 60 days. Relative VE of first booster dose compared to PVS was 58% (95% CI 1 - 82) at 7- 29 days following vaccination, 21% (95% CI -33 - 54) at 30 - 59 days, and -9% (95% CI -82 - 34) at [&ge;] 60 days.  ConclusionIn Georgia, first booster dose VE against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was moderately effective but waned very quickly during Omicron. Increased efforts to vaccinate priority groups in Georgia, such as healthcare workers, prior to periods of anticipated high COVID-19 incidence are essential."

Floods are known to cause direct injury and favor the spread of many waterborne and vector-borne pathogens. Their effect on the circulation of respiratory pathogens, like influenza and SARS-CoV-2, is, however, still unclear. In this study, we quantify this effect through the analysis of large-scale behavioral data coupled to mathematical models of epidemic spread. We focus on the devastating floods occurred in Italy in 2023 and measure how they impacted human contact patterns within and between communities. We find a substantial increase in contacts occurring 3 weeks after the floods, both among residents of the affected areas and between them and those living in distant, unaffected areas of Italy. Then, through mathematical simulations, we determine that these disrupted contact patterns can carry a circulating pathogen to previously unaffected geographic areas, as well as increasing infection counts across the country. Our findings may help set up protocols to use large-scale human contact data to contain epidemic outbreaks before, during and in the aftermath of floods."

Forecast uncertainty was modelled usings a novel gamlss approach which enabled prediction intervals to vary according to the level of the forecast activity.  The winter of 2022-23 was atypical because the demand for healthcare services in children was exceptionally high, due to RSV circulating in the community and increased concerns around invasive Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. However, our short-term forecasts proved to be adaptive forecasting a new higher peak once the increasing demand due to GAS started.

Here, we develop a framework for quantitative triangulation. We first address how to relate study specific research questions to an overall target causal question (relevance), and then assess the directions and magnitudes of bias in each study (rigour), before combining the results using meta-analysis adjusted for the biases.  We illustrate our framework by triangulating evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), Mendelian randomization (MR) and conventional multivariable regression (MVR) to estimate the effect of beta-carotene on coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Five RCTs and one MR study showed little evidence of a causal relationship between beta-carotene and CHD (relative risk (RR)=1.00 with 95% CI=0.98 to 1.01 and RR=1.02 with 95% CI=0.98 to 1.07, respectively). 13 MVR studies indicated that high intake of beta-carotene reduces CHD risk (RR=0.83 with 95% CI0.76 to 0.91). After applying our framework, the three study designs agreed that there is little evidence of an effect of beta-carotene intake on the risk of CHD (RR=1.01 with 95% CI=0.99 to 1.02). Findings were similar for CVD.  Our framework shows how to address rigour and relevance quantitatively when triangulating evidence from different study designs.

In this study, we used conventional PCR coupled with SuCas12a2, a novel Cas12 family RNA-targeting nuclease, to develop a detection approach. SuCas12a2 possesses collateral cleavage activity and cuts the additional single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) added to the reaction system once the ternary complex RNA-SuCas12a2-CRISPR RNA (crRNA) is formed. SuCas12a2 is specifically activated, where the cleaved fluorescent-labeled probes release fluorescent signals, with the strength of the fluorescent signal being proportional to the concentration of nucleic acids specifically bound to crRNA. Simultaneous transcription and SuCas12a2 detection can be performed in a single tube by introducing the T7 promoter sequence into the forward primer. Entamoeba histolytica was used to evaluate the performance of the platform. PCR-SuCas12a2 has excellent capabilities, including high specificity with no cross-reactivity from other species and ultra-sensitivity that achieves a detection of one copy per reaction. There were five samples from amoebiasis patients confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay that were used as proof specimens, where the PCR-SuCas12a2 assay demonstrated 100% specificity. Furthermore, we replaced conventional PCR with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) to simplify the procedure for producing amplicons harboring the T7 promoter sequence. The sensitivity of the RPA-SuCas12a2 assay was 102 copies per reaction, which was inferior to PCR-SuCas12a2, and demonstrated 100% specificity.

There are uncertainties about whether treatments in the acute or post-acute phase of infection can prevent PCC. We report an update to a previous systematic review on the effects of interventions to prevent PCC.  MethodsWe updated our previous peer-reviewed searches on February 9, 2024. We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature resources to identify trials and comparative observational studies reporting on any intervention provided during the acute (symptom onset to 4 weeks) or post-acute phase (4-8 weeks) of COVID-19 and our primary outcome of incidence of PCC, ascertained at 3 months or longer following infection and capturing, at a minimum, symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea and one or more aspects of cognitive function. Non-recovery from COVID-19 was included if necessary. Secondary outcomes included fatigue, breathlessness/dyspnea, post-exertional malaise, health-related quality of life, psychopathology, cognitive impairment, hospitalization, return to work/education, and adverse effects of the intervention. For screening we employed artificial intelligence to prioritize records and modified our methods to rely on single-reviewer screening after 50% of citations were screened in duplicate. Study selection and risk of bias assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers and data extraction relied on verification of another reviewers work. We grouped studies by intervention type and timing, and by acute-care setting, and performed meta-analysis where appropriate. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for the primary outcome, excluding studies with high risk of bias, using non-recovery as a proxy outcome, and evaluating the outcome at more than 12 months of follow-up. We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE.  ResultsTwenty-four studies (5 randomized and 19 non-randomized), all among adults, were included. The acute care setting in nine studies was outpatient and in 15 studies was in-patient; all but one intervention was administered during the acute-phase of illness. The use of convalescent plasma in outpatient acute COVID-19 care probably does not reduce the risk of PCC (relative risk [RR]: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.77-1.12; 1 RCT; moderate certainty). There was low-certainty evidence suggesting that probiotics (RR [95% CI]: 0.32 [0.13-0.78]; 1 RCT) and metformin (0.50 [0.25-0.99]; 1 RCT among individuals with a BMI [&ge;]25 kg/m2) reduce PCC to a small-to-moderate extent in outpatients, while ivermectin (outpatients), antivirals (outpatients), steroids (in-patients), and therapeutic-dose heparin (vs. prophylactic dose; in-patients) may not be effective. Evidence was very low certainty for several other acute-phase pharmacologic intervention and post-acute outpatient assessment and referrals. For outpatient antiviral treatment, while overall PCC risk may not decrease, there might be a slight reduction in psychopathology. Similarly, inpatient antiviral use may not prevent PCC but may offer a small reduction in prolonged general malaise after light exertion. Therapeutic-dose heparin may slightly reduce the risk of cognitive impairment compared to prophylactic-dose heparin among in-patients. The findings remained consistent across all these sensitivity analyses.  ConclusionsEvidence suggests that PCC can be prevented to some extent among outpatients with the use of probiotics and metformin during the acute phase of COVID-19. Effects from interventions used among in-patients and within the post-acute phase are uncertain at this time. Evidence on commonly recommended interventions including rehabilitation or multidisciplinary care was lacking.  Protocol registrationCRD42024513247"

The emergence of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis, the obligate pathogen of TB is a major challenge. The emergence of resistance seems to follow an order that might be exploited for novel therapeutic strategies. In most cases resistance to isoniazid (INH) emerges first, followed by rifampicin, then either pyrazinamide or ethambutol, and finally followed by resistance to second-line drugs. For this reason, it is thought that prevention of emergence of INH resistance may help the prevention of resistance to other drugs. In this manuscript we present the prognostic potential of specific mutations in predicting the emergence of the three most common canonical INH resistance (katG315, inhA-15, and inhA-8) with the hope that majority of resistance cases can be predicted and avoided. Here we present evidence that resistance to INH occurs in steps that in most cases follow specific evolutionary trajectory. Identifying these steps can therefore be used to predict and avoid the most common INH resistance mechanism. In our approach, we used genomic and phenotypic data from over 16,000 samples collected by two large databases, the TB Portals and the CRyPTIC consortium. We used classical sensitivity and specificity values as well as a deep learning neural models to identify promising predictive mutations using TB Portals data. We then tested the prognostic potential of the identified mutations using the CRyPTIC consortium data. Here we report two mutations (Rv1258c 581 indel & mshA A187V) as those carrying the highest potential for predicting the emergence of the three canonical mutations (accuracy of 73% and specificity of 96%). Our results point to a stepwise evolutionary trajectory toward the emergence of the three canonical mutations. Furthermore, the high negative predictive values provide an opportunity for clinicians to continue using INH in new regiments designed for nonresponsive patients whose samples do not contain the two precursor mutations. Finally, we present testable hypotheses describing the role of the precursor mutations in emergence of the three canonical mutations and the predicted trajectories. Mutagenesis experiments can confirm these hypotheses. Additional time course samples and analysis will undoubtedly uncover additional prognostic markers for other trajectories toward high-level INH resistance."

This poses additional threats to already vulnerable populations, further amplified by intersecting social factors, such as gender and socioeconomic status. Currently, critical evidence gaps and inadequate institutional and governance mechanisms impact on the ability for African States to prevent, detect and respond to CSIDs. The aim of this study was to explore the role of data systems and economics to support priority setting for CSID preparedness in sub-Saharan Africa.  We conducted a rapid scoping review to identify existing knowledge and gaps relevant to economics and data systems. A literature search was performed across six bibliographic databases in November 2023. A list of 14 target pathogens, identified by the World Health Organization as Public Health Emergencies of International Concern or R&D Blueprint Pathogens, was adopted and compared to a database of CSIDs to determine relevant inclusion criteria. Extracted data were synthesised using bibliometric analysis, thematic topic categorisation, and narrative synthesis to identify research needs, evidence gaps, and opportunities for priority setting.  We identified 68 relevant studies. While African author involvement has been increasing since 2010, few studies were led by senior authors from African institutions. Data system studies (n = 50) showed broad coverage across CSIDs and the WHO AFRO region but also a high degree of heterogeneity, indicating a lack of clearly defined standards for data systems related to pandemic preparedness. Economic studies (n = 18) primarily focused on COVID-19 and Ebola and mostly originated from South Africa. Both data system and economic studies identified limited data sharing across sectors and showed a notable absence of gender sensitivity analyses. These significant gaps highlight important opportunities to support priority setting and decision-making for pandemic preparedness, ultimately leading to more equitable health outcomes."

Plasmodium falciparum Reticulocyte Binding Protein Homologue 5 (Pfrh5) is a potential malaria vaccine candidate, given its limited polymorphism compared to other parasites blood stage antigens. This study evaluated the genetic diversity of the Pfrh5 gene among parasites from regions with varying malaria transmission intensities in Mainland Tanzania, to generate baseline data for this potential malaria vaccine candidate.  MethodsThis study utilized secondary data of 697 whole-genome sequences from Mainland Tanzania, which were generated by the MalariaGEN Community Network. The samples which were sequenced to generate the data were collected between 2010 and 2015 from five districts within five regions of Mainland Tanzania, with varying endemicities (Morogoro urban district in Morogoro region, Muheza district in Tanga region, Kigoma-Ujiji district in Kigoma region, Muleba district in Kagera region, and Nachingwea district in Lindi region). The genetic diversity of the Pfrh5 gene was assessed using different genetic metrics, including Wrights fixation index (FST), Wrights inbreeding coefficient (Fws), Principal Component analysis (PCA), nucleotide diversity ({pi}), haplotype network, haplotype diversity (Hd), Tajimas D, and Linkage disequilibrium (LD).  ResultsOf the sequences used in this study (n=697), 84.5% (n = 589/697) passed quality control and 313 (53.1%) were monoclonal, and these monoclonal sequences were used for haplotype diversity and haplotype network analysis. High within-host diversity (Fws <0.95) was reported in Kigoma-Ujiji (60.7%), Morogoro urban (53.1%), and Nachingwea (50.8%), while Muleba (53.9%) and Muheza (61.6%) had low within host diversity (Fws[&ge;]0.95). PCA did not show any population structure across the five districts and the mean FST value among the study populations was 0.015. Low nucleotide diversity values were observed across the study sites with the mean nucleotide diversity of 0.00056. A total of 27 haplotypes were observed among the 313 monoclonal samples. The Pf3D7 was detected as Hap_1, and it was detected in 16/313 (5.1%) sequences, and these sample sequences were from Muheza (62.5%, n=10/16), Kigoma-Ujiji (18.8%, n=3/16), and Muleba (18.8%, n=3/16). Negative Tajimas D values were observed among the parasite populations in all the study sites.  ConclusionIn this study, we observed low levels of polymorphism in the pfrh5 gene, as it exhibited low nucleotide and haplotype diversity, a lack of population structure and negative Tajimas D values as signatures of purifying selection. This study provides an essential framework of the diversity of the Pfrh5 gene to be considered in development of the next generation malaria vaccines. Robust and intensive studies of this and other candidate genes are required for characterization of the parasites from areas with varying endemicity, and are crucial to support the prioritization of the Pfrh5 gene for potential inclusion in a broadly cross-protective malaria vaccine."

Although its effectiveness has been estimated to range between 36-86%, the persistence of protection is still unknown.  Aims of this study is to assess the immune response one year after vaccination with MVA-BN.  MethodsObservational prospective study at the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome. All people at high risk for mpox infection who received MVA-BN as pre-exposure prophylaxis were enrolled. People previously primed with smallpox vaccination received a single-dose course of MVA-BN, while non-primed received a two-dose course. Blood samples were collected at the time of each dose and one, six and 12 months after vaccination. MPXV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers were assessed by immunofluorescence and plaque neutralization tests, respectively. Interferon-{gamma} producing T-cell specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine was analyzed by ELISpot assay. Antibody titers at pre- and post-vaccination were compared using the Friedman tests. Mann Whitney test was used to compare antibody titers in PLWH vs PLWoH. Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney non-parametric tests were used to compare T-cells specific response to the MVA-BN vaccine for intra and inter-group differences, respectively.  ResultsFifty high-risk people were included. All were men, with 94% self-reporting having sex with men. The median age was 50 years (IQR 45-57), and 21 (42%) were people living with HIV (PLWH), all on antiretroviral therapy, and 71% with a CD4 cell count higher than 500 L. 25 (50%) have been primed with previous smallpox vaccination.  In non-primed people, anti-MPXV IgG titers significantly increased from T1 to T3 and, despite a slight reduction, were still higher than T1 up to T4 and then gradually decreased until T5, when 64% of sera were still reactive. MPXV-nAb titers peaked at T3 and then dropped, with 56% and 32% of sera reactive at T4 and T5, respectively. IFN-{gamma} production by MVA-BN-specific T-cells progressively rose across time, peaked at T3, and remained significantly higher than the baseline after 6 and 12 months from vaccination. A single-dose course of MVA-BN vaccination in smallpox-primed participants elicited an early increase in IgG and nAb titers, which remained significantly higher than baseline after 6 and 12 months. MPXV-nAbs were detected in 80% and 72% of vaccinees at T4 and T5, respectively. A similar improvement and maintenance were observed for the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response. No evidence for a difference in both humoral and cellular responses was found between PLWH and PLWoH in our cohort.  ConclusionsOne year after vaccination, our data showed the persistent detectability of low levels of nAb against MPXV in one-third of non-primed individuals. At the same time, humoral response was still detectable in most previously vaccinated participants. Concurrently, the MVA-BN-specific T-cell response was robust and persistent."

However, the behavior of relative proportion of emerging variants is an understudied field. We investigated the emerging behavior of dominant COVID-19 variants using nonlinear statistical methods and calculated the time to dominance of each variant.  MethodWe used a phenomenological approach to model national- and regional-level variant share data from the national genomic surveillance system provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine the best model to describe the emergence of two recent dominant variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus: XBB.1.5 and JN.1. The proportions were modeled using logistic, Weibull, and generalized additive models. Model performance was evaluated using the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and the root mean square error (RMSE).  FindingsThe Weibull model performed the worst out of all three approaches. The generalized additive model approach slightly outperformed the logistic model based on fit statistics, but lacked in interpretability compared to the logistic model. These models were then used to estimate the time elapsed from emergence to dominance in the infected population, denoted by the time to dominance (TTD). All three models yielded similar TTD estimates. The XBB.1.5 variant was found to dominate the population faster compared to the JN.1 variant, especially in HHS Region 2 (New York) where the XBB.1.5 was believed to emerge. This research expounds on how emerging viral strains transition to dominance, informing public health interventions against future emergent COVID-19 variants and other infectious diseases."

DiD IT is part of a daily all hazards syndromic surveillance service. We present a validation of the  DiD IT tool, using synthetic injects to assess how well it can estimate small, localised increases in the number of people presenting to health care. Furthermore, we assess how control settings within  DiD IT affect its performance.   DiD IT was validated across ten different syndromic indicators, chosen to cover a range of data volumes and potential public health threats. Injects were added across different times of year and days of week, including public holidays. Also, different size of injects were created, including some with an impact spread to neighbouring locations or spread over several days. The control settings within  DiD IT were tested by varying the control location and periods, using, for example a  washout period or excluding nearest neighbours. Performance was measured by comparing the estimates for excess counts produced by  DiD IT with the actual synthetic injects added.   DiD IT was able to provide a positive estimate in 99.8% of trials, with a mean absolute error of 1.5. However, confidence intervals for the central estimate could not be produced in 42.5% of trials. Furthermore, the 95% confidence intervals for the central estimates only included the actual inject count within 62.8% of the intervals. Unsurprising, mean errors were slightly higher when synthetic injects were not concentrated in one location on one day but were spread across neighbouring areas or days. Selecting longer control periods and using more locations as controls tended to lower the errors slightly. Including a washout period or excluding neighbouring locations from the controls did not improve performance.  We have shown that  DiD IT is accurate for assessing the impact of local incidents but that further work is needed to improve the how the uncertainty of these estimates are communicated to users."

Our case study centers on the epidemiology of emerging infectious diseases. We develop an efficient algorithm to train our proposed KAN-UDE models using time series data generated by traditional SIR models. Compared to the UDE based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), training KAN-UDE models shows significantly improves fitting performance in terms of the accuracy, as evidenced by a rapid and substantial reduction in the loss. Additionally, using KAN, we accurately reconstruct the nonlinear functions represented by neural networks in the KAN-UDE models across four distinct models with varying incidence rates, which is robustness in terms of using a subset of time series data to train the model. This approach enables an interpretable learning process, as KAN-UDE models were reconstructed to fully mechanistic models (RMMs). While KAN-UDE models perform well in short-term prediction when trained on a subset of the data, they exhibit lower robustness and accuracy when real-world data randomness is considered. In contrast, RMMs predict epidemic trends robustly and with high accuracy over much longer time windows (i.e., long-term prediction), as KAN precisely reconstructs the mechanistic functions despite data randomness. This highlights the importance of interpretable learning in reconstructing the mechanistic forms of complex functions. Although our validation focused on the transmission dynamics of emerging infectious diseases, the promising results suggest that KAN-UDEs have broad applicability across various fields."

Studies assessing outcomes during treatment (e.g., premature hospital discharge) or afterward (e.g., rehospitalization; all-cause mortality) typically had smaller sample sizes and imprecise effect estimates.  ConclusionsInjecting-related infections and treatment outcomes may be shaped by multiple social contextual factors. Approaches to prevention and treatment should look beyond individual injecting practices towards addressing the social and material conditions within which people live, acquire and consume drugs, and access health care."

We then examined how 2011-2020 incidence is associated with post-2020 cholera occurrence and investigated the potential reach of prospective interventions when prioritized by past incidence.  FindingsAcross 43 African countries mean annual incidence rates remained steady at 11 cases per 100,000 population through both periods.

Many cLBP treatments target risk factors on the assumption that the targeted factor is not just associated with cLBP but is also a cause (i.e, a causal risk factor). In most cases this is a strong assumption, primarily due to the possibility of confounding variables. False assumptions about the causal relationships between risk factors and cLBP likely contribute to the generally marginal results from cLBP treatments.  PurposeThe objectives of this study were to a) using rigorous confounding control compare associations between modifiable causal risk factors identified by Mendelian randomization (MR) studies with associations in a cLBP population and b) estimate the association of these risk factors with cLBP outcomes.  Study Design/SettingCross sectional analysis of a longitudinal, online, observational study.  Patient Sample1,376 participants in BACKHOME, a longitudinal observational e-Cohort of U.S. adults with cLBP that is part of the NIH Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program.  Outcome MeasuresPain, Enjoyment of Life, and General Activity (PEG) Scale.  MethodsFive risk factors were selected based on evidence from MR randomization studies: sleep disturbance, depression, BMI, alcohol use, and smoking status. Confounders were identified using the ESC-DAG approach, a rigorous method for building directed acyclic graphs based on causal criteria. Strong evidence for confounding was found for age, female sex, education, relationship status, financial strain, anxiety, fear avoidance and catastrophizing. These variables were used to determine the adjustment sets for the primary analysis. Potential confounders with weaker evidence were used for a sensitivity analysis.  ResultsParticipants had the following characteristics: age 54.9 {+/-} 14.4 years, 67.4% female, 60% never smokers, 29.9% overweight, 39.5% obese, PROMIS sleep disturbance T-score 54.8 {+/-} 8.0, PROMIS depression T-score 52.6 {+/-} 10.1, Fear-avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire 11.6 {+/-} 5.9, Patient Catastrophizing Scale 4.5 {+/-} 2.6, PEG 4.4 {+/-} 2.2.

The adjusted effect estimates- the expected change in the PEG outcome for every standard deviation increase or decrease in the exposure (or category shift for categorical exposures) were the largest for sleep disturbance and obesity. Each SD increase in the PROMIS sleep disturbance T-score resulted in a mean 0.77 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.88) point increase in baseline PEG score. Compared to participants with normal BMI, adjusted mean PEG score was slightly higher by 0.37 points (95% CI: 0.09, 0.65) for overweight participants, about 0.8 to 0.9 points higher for those in obesity classes I and II, and 1.39 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.80) points higher for the most obese participants. Each SD increase in the PROMIS depression T-score was associated with a mean 0.28 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.40) point increase in baseline PEG score, while each SD decrease in number of alcoholic drinks per week resulted in a mean 0.12 (95%CI: 0.01, 0.23) increase in baseline PEG score in the adjusted model.

MethodsProteome-wide Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was conducted to identify plasma proteins causally related to AD risk using the largest summary-level data to date, followed by colocalization and multi-omic validation analyses (on the gene expression, alternative splicing, and DNA methylation levels in blood and brain, respectively) to prioritize potential druggable targets. We also replicated our MR findings using additional genetic data and, where appropriate, performed multivariable MR for the prioritized findings. Conventional observational analysis using the data from UK Biobank, a large prospective cohort, was performed to provide further clinical implications for our genetic findings.  ResultsMR analysis identified 15 plasma proteins with putative causal effects on AD risk. Of them, inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was found to increase the risk of AD (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.08-1.14), which was likely independent of blood pressure as suggested by multivariable MR. Observational analysis in UK Biobank showed a higher incidence (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.52) of AD among regular users of ACE inhibitors (ACEI), compared with the counterpart angiotensin receptor blocker users.  ConclusionsIn addition to expanding the understanding of druggable targets for AD prevention, our findings highlighted the potential risk of AD associated with the use of ACEIs, a widely prescribed antihypertensive medication, suggesting the need for caution in clinical practice and further research on the effect of antihypertensives on neurodegenerative diseases."

The aim of our study was to understand the microbiota and resistome of hospital effluent, and its role in the spread of AMR in the marine environment in Norway. We further aimed at describing/characterizing novel resistance factors from hospital effluent and the receiving sewage treatment plant (STP). 24-hour composite samples of the hospital effluent and the influent and effluent of the receiving STP were collected at two sampling time-points (February and April 2023) in Bergen city, Norway. Isolation of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. was performed, using ECC and SCAI plates with cefotaxime, tigecycline or meropenem, followed by antibiotic susceptibility testing, using EUVSEC3 plates. Whole-genome sequencing of selected strains (n=36) and shotgun metagenomics of sewage samples (n=6) were performed, using Illumina NovaSeq. ARGs were identified with USEARCH, and known and novel ARGs were assembled with fARGene. All E. coli strains (n=66) were multidrug-resistant (MDR), while 92.3% of the Klebsiella spp. strains (n=55) showed MDR phenotype. The sequenced strains carried multiple clinically important ARGs, including carbapenemases such as NDM-5 (n=3) and KPC-3 (n=3). We obtained 238 Gigabases of sequence data from which we identified 676 unique ARGs with >200 ARGs shared across samples. We assembled 1,205 ARGs using fARGene, 365 gene sequences represented novel ARGs (< 90% amino acid (aa) identity). Both known and novel ARGs (n=54) were shared between the hospital effluent and the treated effluent of the receiving STP. We show that hospital effluent in Norway has a high diversity of both known and novel ARGs. Our study demonstrates that hospital effluent is a source of clinically relevant pathogens, as well as known and novel ARGs, reaching the marine environment in Norway through treated sewage."

Toxin neutralization protects the host from toxin-induced damage, while leaving the organism intact. OPK inducing antibodies clear the bacteria but leave the released toxins unencountered. Infection site targeted anti-toxin antibodies (ISTAbs) that we report here addresses this binary paradigm by combining both functionalities into a single molecule. ISTAbs consist of cell wall targeting (CWT) domains of bacteriophage endolysins fused to toxin neutralizing mAbs (IgG). CWT governs specific binding to the surface of bacteria while the IgG variable domain neutralizes the toxins as they are released. The complex is then cleared by phagocytic cells. As proof of concept, we generated several ISTAb prototypes targeting major toxins from two Gram-positive spore forming pathogens that have a high clinical significance; Clostridium difficile, causative agent of the most common hospital-acquired infection, and Bacillus anthracis, a Category A select agent pathogen. Both groups of ISTAbs exhibited potent toxin neutralization, binding to their respective bacterial cells, and induction of opsonophagocytosis. In mice infected with B. anthracis, ISTAbs exhibit significantly higher efficacy than parental IgG in both pre- and post-challenge models. Furthermore, ISTAbs fully protected against B. anthracis infection in a nonhuman primate (NHP) aerosol challenge model. These findings establish that as a platform technology, ISTAbs are broadly applicable for therapeutic intervention against several toxigenic bacterial pathogens."

MABC consists of three subspecies, and it is recommended that the three subspecies be distinguished because of their differing macrolide susceptibilities. Unfortunately, current methods are inefficient due to their high cost, complexity, and time requirements. The third-generation Bruker MALDI Biotyper (MBT) Sirius has the capability to detect phospholipids and glycolipids using negative-ion mode. Mycobacterial cell walls are rich in lipids, and if lipid structure diversity can serve as species-specific fingerprints, this method may provide an alternative for microbial identification. This study aimed to examine the accuracy of discriminating between the three MABC subspecies by lipid profiling. Our best model failed to differentiate the three subspecies. Even in the two-dimensional space of the most significant peaks, M. abscessus and M. massiliense could not be separated. The agreement rate between lipid fingerprint-based and WGS-based identification was, at most, 47.2% for negative-ion mode. Even after applying recent machine learning algorithms to detect variables and create predictive models, accuracy remained at 50%.

Further advancements and standardization of MALDI-TOF MS-based methods are necessary for the routine differentiation of MABC subspecies in clinical settings."

In mouse models, colon epithelial peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-{gamma} (PPAR-{gamma}) signaling limits oxygen and nitrate luminal bioavailability, thereby preventing bacterial pathogen colonization. However, whether this mechanism operates similarly in humans remains uncertain. To investigate, we used the cloud-based TriNetX Analytics Platform which aggregates health records from 117 million patients across 66 US healthcare organizations, to assess the risk of bacterial enteric infection among diabetic patients prescribed thiazolidinediones, a class of PPAR-{gamma} agonists. Among 85,117 thiazolidinedione users, we observed a 22-49% lower risk of bacterial enteric infections compared to users of other anti-diabetes medications. This reduction in risk was consistent across high-risk individuals, regardless of sex or age. Similar results were replicated in high-risk patients when thiazolidinedione users were directly compared to those on DPP-4 inhibitors. These findings support the potential protective role of PPAR-{gamma} signaling against bacterial enteric infection and call for further clinical investigation."

Neonatal blood or cerebrospinal fluid cultures from 2012-2021 identified 205 E. coli isolates, and 170 could be recovered for sequencing.

The causative monkeypox virus (MPXV) belonged to Clade IIb and transmitted through sexual contact with a low case fatality rate (0.1%), which together with underdetection, all contributed to a rapid global spread particularly within the MSM (men who have sex with men) community. As MPXV Clade II remains circulating worldwide, a new outbreak of the more fatal Clade I disease has been declared in Central and East Africa and remains uncontrolled in part due to the lack of Point of Care (POC) diagnostics for rapid decisions on treatment and self-isolation.  AimTo address the lack of POC solutions for mpox we have designed and evaluated an orthopoxvirus-specific lateral flow device (LFD) that could be used for diagnosis of mpox.  ResultsUsing an LFD comprising four monoclonal antibodies against the A27 protein we demonstrate sensitivity to 3x105 pfu/ml. This sensitivity is expected to be sufficient for detection of MPXV from lesion sites and may also be sufficient for other sample types such as saliva and urine. However, sample collection buffer may have a detrimental impact on sensitivity for clinical material.  ConclusionPoint of care (POC) diagnosis of mpox may be possible using a LFD to reduce delays arising from sample shipment to centralised laboratory testing facilities."

Living in areas with high ruminant density has been associated with excess risk of infection, which could be due to both direct ruminant contact and residual environmental risk, but the role of each is unclear. We investigated whether there is any meaningful risk to individuals living in ruminant-dense areas if they do not have direct contact with ruminants. Using a Bayesian spatial framework, we investigated the association between the density of ruminants on feedlots and STEC incidence in Minnesota from 2010 to 2019, stratified by serogroup and season, and adjusting for direct ruminant contact. For every additional head of cattle or sheep per 10 acres, the incidence of O157 STEC infection increased by 30% (IRR 1.30; 95% CrI 1.18, 1.42) or 135% (IRR 2.35; 95% CrI 1.14, 4.20), respectively, during the summer months. Sheep density was also associated with O157 STEC risk during winter (IRR 4.28; 95% CrI 1.40, 8.92). The risk of non-O157 STEC infection was only elevated in areas with goat operations during summer (IRR 19.6; 95% CrI 1.69, 78.8). STEC risk associated with ruminant density was independent of direct ruminant contact across serogroups and seasons. Our findings demonstrate that living in a ruminant-dense area increases an individuals risk of O157 and non-O157 STEC infection even without direct ruminant contact, indicating that prevention efforts need to extend to community strategies for averting indirect transmission from local ruminant populations.  IO_SCPLOWMPORTANCEC_SCPLOWSTEC are zoonotic enteric bacteria responsible for 2.5 million illnesses each year. Infections in young children can be especially devastating, causing hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a debilitating and sometimes fatal form of acute kidney injury. STECs primary reservoirs are cattle and other domestic ruminants, and transmission can occur through food, water, animal contact, and person-to-person. Living near ruminants poses a significant risk of STEC infection; however, the proportion of that risk due to direct ruminant contact or other routes of transmission is unknown. Our research demonstrates that direct ruminant contact is a substantial risk irrespective of location, and that individuals living in ruminant-rich regions are at high risk of STEC infection regardless of whether they come into contact with ruminants. These findings indicate a need for multi-pronged prevention efforts that emphasize control of contamination in the environments surrounding ruminant populations, in addition to biosafety precautions when contacting ruminants directly."

past few decades for unclear reasons, and the etiology of the disease remains largely unknown. Known genetic risk factors do not explain this increase, pointing to possible environmental and as-yet unidentified genetic contributors and their interactions. Previous research linked genetic variation on chromosome 6 to increased CRC risk. This region harbors multiple immune genes, including the gene encoding Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA). MICA is a polygenic ligand for the Natural Killer Group 2D receptor (NKG2D), a receptor expressed on Natural Killer (NK) cells and other lymphocytes. Given that intra-tumoral NK cell infiltration correlates with favorable CRC outcomes, we hypothesized that germline genetic variation in MICA could influence CRC risk. In a discovery set of 40,125 cases and controls, we show that the minor G allele at Chr6:31373718C>G (hg19) is associated with increased risk for CRC (odds ratio (OR) = 1.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 - 1.15, p = 0.0009). The effect is stronger in EOCRC (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.08 - 1.44, p = 0.0023) than in those 50 and over (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.13; p = 0.012) (Ratio of ORs = 1.32, 95% CI 1.14 - 1.52, p = 0.0002). In an independent validation set of 77,983 cases and controls, the adjusted interaction by age-of-onset was significant at OR = 1.15 (95% CI 1.03 - 1.34, p = 0.0150) with a higher risk in EOCRC. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in normal colonic epithelia showed that MICA RNA expression decreases linearly with each additional copy of the minor G allele (p = 3.345 x 10e-18). Bulk RNA analysis of the tumor immune microenvironment revealed that tumors from patients with CG or GG genotypes have lower resting and activated NK cell infiltration as compared to tumors from patients with CC genotype. Multiplex immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that patients with a G allele (i.e. CG or GG genotype, but not CC genotype) have a statistically significant decrease in the number of NK cells in tumor compared to adjacent normal colonic mucosa. Taken together, population-based epidemiologic, molecular, genetic, cellular and immunologic evidence demonstrate that MICA genotype is associated with increased risk of EOCRC and reduced number of NK cells in colorectal tumors, suggesting that patients with a G allele have altered NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance. These novel findings suggest that EOCRC may have a previously unrecognized innate immune-mediated etiology which merits further investigation."

To inform the design of severe infection prevention RCTs for young infants in low-resource settings, we estimated the incidence of severe infection in an observational cohort of Bangladeshi infants aged 0-60 days and examined the effect of variations in case definitions on incidence estimates.  MethodsIn 2020-2022, 1939 infants born generally healthy were enrolled at two hospitals in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Severe infection cases were identified through up to 12 scheduled community health worker home visits from 0-60 days of age or through caregiver self-referral. The primary severe infection case definition combined physician documentation of standardized clinical signs and/or diagnosis of sepsis/SBI and either a positive blood culture or parenteral antibiotic treatment for [&ge;]5 days. Incidence rates were estimated for the primary severe infection definition, the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of possible SBI, blood culture- confirmed infection, and five alternative severe infection definitions.  ResultsSevere infection incidence per 1000 infant-days was 1.2 (95% CI 0.97-1.4) using the primary definition, 0.84 (0.69-1.0) using the WHO definition of possible SBI, and 0.026 (0.0085- 0.081) using blood culture-confirmed infection. One-third of cases met the primary criteria for severe infection through physician diagnosis of sepsis/SBI rather than the standardized clinical signs and 85% were identified following caregiver self-referral despite frequent scheduled study visits.  ConclusionSevere infection incidence in young infants varied considerably by case definition. Using a clinical sign-based severe infection definition may miss a substantial proportion of cases identified by physician diagnosis of sepsis/SBI. In settings where health facilities are accessible, and caregivers seek care for infant illness, frequently scheduled home assessments by study personnel to identify severe infection in infants may not be necessary.  What is already known on this topicO_LIResearchers aiming to design a randomized controlled trial (RCT) for severe infection prevention or treatment in young infants require a clinically precise and feasible case definition of severe infection. C_LIO_LIThere is no consensus definition of severe infection for neonates or young infants. A previous systematic review of neonatal sepsis definitions used in RCTs identified a diverse range, including culture-confirmed sepsis, a combination of clinical signs and culture-confirmation, and a combination of clinical signs and laboratory investigation results. C_LIO_LIIncidence estimates of various severe infection case definitions that can be operationalized in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are needed to determine the feasibility of using these definitions in severe infection prevention and treatment RCTs for young infants in these settings. C_LI  What this study addsO_LIWe provide incidence estimates of severe infection in young infants born generally healthy in Dhaka, Bangladesh, during the first 60 days of age using case definitions based on different combinations of clinical signs, antibiotic treatment and microbiologic criteria. C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that the incidence estimates of severe infection in young infants vary considerably depending on whether a permissive or stringent case definition is adopted. C_LIO_LIWe also demonstrate that in this study, most severe infection cases were identified following caregiver self-referral rather than during scheduled home assessments by study personnel. C_LI  How this study might affect research, practice or policyO_LIOur findings may inform the design of future severe infection prevention RCTs in young infants in LMICs by 1) providing incidence estimates of various candidate case definitions, and 2) supporting the planning of optimal outcome surveillance systems that balance the identification of severe infection cases with operational costs.

We conducted a cross-sectional clinical trial involving 227 highland and 202 lowland dwellers from the Tigray region in Northern Ethiopia to gain a general insight into the biological aging at high altitudes. Notably, we observed significantly lower risk exposure rates and a reduced disease burden in higher-altitude regions of Ethiopia. When assessing biological aging using facial photographs, we found a faster rate of aging with increasing elevation, likely due to greater UV exposure. Conversely, analysis of nuclear morphologies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in blood smears (PBMCs) with five different senescence predictors revealed a significant decrease in DNA damage-induced senescence in both monocytes and lymphocytes with increasing elevation. Overall, our findings suggest that disease and DNA damage-induced senescence decreases with altitude in agreement with the idea that oxidative stress may drive aging."

We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.  MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.  ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).  ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients.

METHODSIn the FinnTwin16 cohort, 3,431 twins (47% men) reported smoking status, LTPA, and WC in early adulthood and 10 years later. Regression models were conducted to investigate associations of smoking status and of LTPA change (metabolic equivalent tasks [MET]-h/week) with WC change (cm) during the follow-up. Within-pair associations were analyzed using linear mixed fixed-effect regression among 800 same-sexed (409 identical) pairs.  RESULTSDuring the 10-year follow-up, 40% (n=454) quit smoking. Among those who quit smoking, the mean WC increase was 7.4 cm (SD 8.2) and the mean LTPA decrease was -0.02 MET-h/week (SD 35.8). Compared to individuals continuing daily smoking, only quitters who smoked daily at baseline ({beta} 1.87; 95% CI 0.68, 3.06) increased their WC. This association was not robust after shared familial influences were controlled for. Each additional MET-h/week lowered the risk for WC increase among individuals who smoked occasionally ({beta} -0.054; -0,08, -0.003), quitters who smoked daily ({beta} -0.05; -0.06, -0.02) and those who had never smoked ({beta} -0.04; -0.05, -0.03). In the analyses among identical twin pairs, LTPA was associated with less WC increase among those who quit occasional smoking or had never smoked. For quitters from daily smoking, this association approached significance, but no association remained for those continuing smoking.  CONCLUSIONSSmoking cessation seems to be associated with WC increase, but familial confounding is involved in this process. LTPA may inhibit post-cessation WC increase.  KEY MESSAGESThis will be published as a summary box after the abstract in the final published article.  What is already known on this topic1. Individuals quitting smoking tend to gain weight, but less is known of post-cessation abdominal obesity and the role of leisure-time physical activity in this process.   What this study adds2. Smoking cessation associates with moderate increase in waist circumference among those who quit daily smoking, but shared familial influences are involved in this process. 3. Increase in leisure-time physical activity may prevent post-cessation waist circumference increase.   How this study might affect research, practice, or policy4. More research is needed to unravel genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying post-cessation waist circumference increase. 5. In practice, individuals who quit smoking should be encouraged to be physically active."

According to the World Health Organizations (WHO) World Malaria Report 2023, there were approximately 249 million reported malaria cases in 2022 across 85 endemic countries, resulting in over half a million deaths. Progress towards global malaria eradication through antimalarial drugs has been slow, with case numbers increasing since 2015. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), artesunate, and artemether, derivatives of artemisinin, are crucial components of modern antimalarial treatment. However, resistance to these drugs and their partners in Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) has emerged in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. In 2021, the WHO recommended widespread use of the RTS,S malaria vaccine among children in endemic regions. To address these challenges, we develop an extended SEIR age-structured model incorporating malaria vaccination for children, drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, and interactions between human hosts and mosquitoes. Our research focuses on evaluating how malaria vaccination coverage influences disease prevalence and transmission dynamics. We derive the basic, intervention, and invasion reproduction numbers for both strains and conduct sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters affecting infection prevalence. Our findings reveal that model outcomes are primarily influenced by scale factors that reduce transmission and natural recovery rates for the resistant strain, as well as by drug treatment and vaccination efficacies, and mosquito death rates. Numerical simulations indicate that while treatment reduces the malaria disease burden, it also increases the proportion of drug-resistant cases. Conversely, higher vaccination efficacy correlates with lower infection cases for both strains. These results suggest that a synergistic approach, involving both vaccination and treatment, could effectively decrease the overall proportion of the population that is infected."

Antimalarial medications differ in their efficacy in clearing the transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum (gametocytes) and in preventing mosquito infection. Here we present a combined analysis of six trials conducted at the same study site with highly consistent methodologies that allows for a direct comparison of the gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities of fifteen different antimalarial regimens or dosing schedules. Methods and findings Between January 2013 and January 2023, six clinical trials with transmission endpoints were conducted at the Clinical Research Centre of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako in Mali. These trials tested Artemisinin-Combination Therapies (ACTs), non-ACT regimens and combinations with 8-aminoquinolines. Participants were males and non-pregnant females, between 5-50 years of age, who presented with P. falciparum mono-infection and gametocyte carriage by microscopy. Blood samples were taken before and after treatment for thick film microscopy, infectivity assessments by mosquito feeding assays and molecular quantification of gametocytes. Mixed-effects generalized linear models were fit with individual-specific random effects and fixed effects for time points, treatment groups and their interaction. Models quantified changes in mosquito infection rates and gametocyte densities within treatment arms over time and between treatments. In a pooled analysis of 422 participants, we observed substantial differences between ACTs in gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities, with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) being significantly more potent at reducing mosquito infection rates within 48 hours than dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and pyronaridine-artesunate (PY-AS) (p<0.0001). The addition of single low dose primaquine (SLD PQ) accelerated gametocyte clearance and led to a significantly greater reduction in mosquito infection rate within 48-hours of treatment for each ACT, while an SLD of the 8-aminoaquinoline tafenoquine (TQ) showed a delayed but effective response compared to SLD primaquine. Finally, our findings confirmed considerably higher post-treatment transmission after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP-AQ) compared to most ACTs, with a significantly lower relative reduction in mosquito infection rate at day 7 compared to DHA-PPQ, AS-AQ, and AL (p<0.0001). Therefore, adding an SLD PQ to SP-AQ may be beneficial to block malaria transmission in community treatment campaigns. Conclusions We found marked differences among ACTs and single low-dose 8-aminoquinoline drugs in their ability and speed to block transmission. The findings from this analysis can support treatment policy decisions for malaria elimination and be integrated into mathematical models to improve the accuracy of predictions regarding community transmission and the spread of drug resistance under varying treatment guidelines."

The incidence of LTBI among the HCWs has seldom been investigated. Primary health centres (PHCs) provide effective and affordable medical care largely for the local population. The HCWs of PHCs who are likely to have increased occupational exposure have an increased risk of reactive as well as LTBI, and contribute to overall TB transmission than the general population. Methods A cross-sectional study (March-April 2024) was carried out to assess the burden of LTBI among the HCWs of PHCs (n=64) across Chennai, India. Blood samples were analyzed for gamma interferon using a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay. A complete baseline health profile, including complete blood count, blood glucose, liver and renal functions, and ferritin levels was estimated to identify potential biomarkers that are independently associated with LTBI. Results The present study revealed an LTBI prevalence of 25.3% (n=99) among PHC workers. The red cell distribution width was significantly associated with LTBI positivity among different biochemical and haematological parameters analyzed. Factors such as individuals age, underlying comorbid conditions (30.3%; n=30), and longer employment duration (28%; n=28) were significantly associated with IGRA positivity. IGRA positivity was significantly associated with decreased RDW-SD in females, overweight, and participants with O blood group. Conclusions The study reported a high prevalence of LTBI among HCWs of PHCs, which necessitates their periodical screening for the elimination of TB."

Family planning counseling, when engaging with maternal healthcare services, may enhance modern contraceptive uptake in the postpartum period. However, evidence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has yielded conflicting findings. We aimed to explore the effects of family planning counseling delivered as part of maternal healthcare on postpartum modern contraceptive uptake in LMICs. Methods: The following six databases were searched in April 2024: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, Medline, and Scopus. Studies that examined the association between family planning counseling and modern contraception uptake in the postpartum period were included. The findings of the included studies were summarized narratively and through a random-effects meta-analysis when data supported. Trim and fill estimates and subgroup analyses were conducted to address publication bias and heterogeneity, respectively. Results: A total of 61 studies were included, of which 42 studies were considered for quantitative synthesis and the remaining 19 studies included in a narrative synthesis. We found that women who received family planning counseling during maternal healthcare visits were 2.75 times (95% CI, 2.11-3.58) more likely to use modern contraception during the postpartum period compared to those who did not receive family planning counseling. Although we observed significant publication bias and heterogeneity, addressing these issues through trim and fill estimation and subgroup analyses, respectively, produced estimates consistent with the summary findings. A narrative synthesis of an additional 19 studies also supports the effectiveness of family planning counseling during maternal healthcare visits on postpartum modern contraception uptake. Conclusion: Integrating family planning counseling into maternal healthcare can significantly increase modern contraceptive use in the postpartum period, as such effectively reducing unintended and short interval pregnancy as well as adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Policymakers should prioritize training healthcare providers and developing standardized protocols for effective counseling."

We estimate the epidemiological impact of this SARS-CoV-2 lineage replacement in Brazil and we further assessed the cross-reactive neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients infected during 2023. We analyzed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in Brazil between July 2023 and March 2024. We evaluated the cross-reactive NAb responses to the JN.1 variant in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients, both before and after infection with XBB.1* lineages. JN.1 replaced XBB with similar temporal dynamics across all country regions, though its epidemiological impact varied between locations. The Southeastern, Southern, and Central-Western regions experienced a brief XBB wave around October 2023, shortly before the introduction of JN.1, without any immediate upsurge of SARI cases during viral lineage replacement. By contrast, the Northeastern and Northern regions did not experience an XBB wave in the latter half of 2023 and displayed a rapid surge in SARI cases driven by the emergence of the JN.1. We found that recent XBB infections in the Brazilian population significantly boosted cross-reactive NAb levels against JN.1. The XBB wave observed in the second half of 2023 in some Brazilian states likely acted as a booster for population immunity, providing short-term protection against JN.1 infections and delaying the rise of SARI cases in certain regions of the country."

The gut microbiome enables protection against diverse pathogens and exhibits dysbiosis during infectious and autoimmune disease. Studies based in the United States and China have found that severe COVID-19 cases have altered gut microbiome composition when compared to mild COVID-19 cases. We present the first study to investigate the gut microbiome composition of COVID-19 cases in a population from Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the impact of geography and cultural traditions on microbiome composition, it is important to investigate the microbiome globally and not draw broad conclusions from homogenous populations. Results: We used stool samples in a Ugandan biobank collected from COVID-19 cases during 2020-2022. We profiled the gut microbiomes of 114 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 along with 76 household contacts who did not present any symptoms of COVID-19. The inclusion of healthy controls enables us to generate hypotheses about bacterial strains potentially related to susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, which is highly heterogeneous. Comparison of the COVID-19 patients and their household contacts revealed decreased alpha diversity and blooms of Enterococcus and Eggerthella in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our study finds that the microbiome of COVID-19 individuals is more likely to be disrupted, as indicated by decreased diversity and increased pathobiont levels. This is either a consequence of the disease or may indicate that certain microbiome states increase susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Our findings enable comparison with cohorts previously published in the Global North, as well as support new hypotheses about the interaction between the gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection."

However, manual SOFA calculation is time consuming. Thus, we developed an automated real-time SOFA score application that has been fully implemented into the major electronic health record (EHR) system (TakeCare) in Stockholm. We aimed to describe the method and evaluate its performance for detection of sepsis. Method: We developed an automated SOFA application that presents a total score (SOFATotal) over time and a baseline score (SOFAChronic) based on outpatient data prior to hospital admission. We evaluated its performance on 583 sepsis alert patients in an emergency department, including 472 with sepsis according to manually calculated SOFA (SOFAManual). SOFATotal at 30 minutes and 3 hours, and quick-SOFA (qSOFA) were compared with SOFAManual for detection of sepsis. The acute SOFA score (SOFAAcute) was calculated by subtracting SOFAChronic from SOFATotal. Results: SOFATotal at 3 hours showed moderate-good agreement with SOFAManual (R2 = 0.76). Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for sepsis detection were 0.83 at 30 minutes, 0.94 at 3 hours for SOFATotal, and 0.67 for qSOFA. Among patients with SOFAChronic [&ge;]1 (21% of cases), SOFATotal of [&ge;]2 was observed in 90% of cases (mortality 13.5%), although SOFAAcute of [&ge;]2 was noted in 63% (mortality 16.7%). Conclusion: The automated SOFA score demonstrated effectiveness in early sepsis detection, outperforming qSOFA, but adjustments for chronic baseline scores were necessary to avoid over-diagnosis. Further studies on broader patient populations would be useful to validate its clinical use."

""Vaccine efficacy"" describes a population-level effect measured in clinical trials, but mathematical models used to evaluate the impact of vaccination campaigns require specifying how vaccines fail at the individual level, which is often impossible to measure. Does 90% efficacy imply perfect protection in 90% of people and no protection in 10% (""all-or-nothing""), or that the per-exposure risk is reduced by 90% in all vaccinated individuals (""leaky""), or somewhere in between? Here we systematically investigate the role of vaccine failure mode in controlling ongoing epidemics. We find that the difference in population-level impact between all-or-nothing and leaky vaccines can be substantial when R0 is higher, vaccines efficacy is intermediate, and vaccines slow but can't curtail an outbreak. Comparing COVID-19 pandemic phases, we show times when model predictions would have been most sensitive to assumptions about vaccine failure mode. When determining the optimal risk group to prioritize for limited vaccines, we find that modeling a leaky vaccine as all-or-nothing (or vice versa) can change the recommended target group. Overall, we conclude that models of vaccination campaigns should include uncertainty about vaccine failure mode in their design and interpretation."

The pandemic revealed the utility of new data sources and highlighted challenges in interpreting surveillance indicators when changes in disease severity, testing practices or reporting occur. Aim: To estimate the trend in new COVID-19 infections by combining estimates of growth rates from all available surveillance indicators in Norway. Methods: We estimated growth rates from ten different surveillance indicators in Norway by using a negative binomial regression method and aligned the growth rates in time to hospital admissions by maximising correlations. Using a meta-analysis framework, we calculated overall growth rates and reproduction numbers, including assessments of the heterogeneity between indicators. Results: The estimated growth rates reached a maximum of 25% per day in March 2020, but afterwards they were between -10% and 10% per day. The correlations between the growth rates estimated from different indicators were between 0.5 and 1.0. Growth rates from indicators based on wastewater, panel and cohort data can give up to 14 days earlier signals of trends compared to hospital admissions, while indicators based on positive lab tests can give signals up to 7 days earlier. Conclusions: Combining estimates of growth rates from multiple surveillance indicators provides a good description of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. This is a powerful technique for a holistic understanding of the trends of new COVID-19 infections and the technique can easily be adapted to new data sources and situations."

Results: A fully parameterized model for CMV among pregnant people and fetuses was developed, and the model code was confirmed to perform as specified. The calibration procedure identified parameter sets that generated model output closely matching the target values from the available data on cCMV prevalence and symptom risk.

Participants with at least one (of six) follow-up measurement for each outcome were included in the analyses. We measured depressive symptoms through self- as well as parent-reports, and assessed several cardio-metabolic risk factors (including adiposity measures, lipid profiles and inflammation). Results: Among our 7970 (47% male) participants, we found bidirectional, within-person associations between self-reported depressive symptoms and adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass index, but not body mass index), across the study period. Adiposity was more stable over time ({beta} [range] = 0.75 [0.54; 0.84]), compared to depressive symptoms (0.26 [0.12; 0.38]), and it had a stronger prospective (i.e., cross-lagged) association with future depressive symptoms (0.07 [0.03, 0.13]) compared to that between depressive symptom and future adiposity (0.04 [0.03, 0.06]). The magnitude of these associations reached its peak between 14 and 16 years. We did not find evidence of cross-lagged associations in either direction between depressive symptoms and waist circumference, insulin, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol or C-reactive protein.

Methods We conducted a discrete choice experiment (DCE) among FSWs [&ge;]18 years recruited from the Most At-Risk Population Initiative (MARPI) clinic in Kampala, Uganda, between October and November 2023. FSWs were recruited using consecutive sampling. To determine the most effective PrEP delivery method for FSWs, we created eight choice sets, each with three alternative combinations of PrEP service attributes and an opt-out using a D-efficient experimental design. Participants were presented with three alternatives, the fourth being an opt-out (no model selected), and asked to make selections based on four distinct attributes: the PrEP provider, place of delivery, delivery channel, and support services. We assessed FSW preferences and attribute trade-offs using a panel data mixed model and identified the preferred PrEP delivery model using the highest median utility score. Results Overall, 203 participants completed the DCE. The median age was 24 years (interquartile range [IQR] 20-32). Most FSWs preferred receiving PrEP from a healthcare worker at the clinic with short message service (SMS) reminders for adherence support (median utility score 0.87; interquartile range [IQR] 0.82, 0.94). This preference remained consistent across all age groups, with a median utility score of 0.88 for ages 15-19, 0.87 for ages 20-24, and 0.85 for ages [&ge;]25.

An estimated 288,000 people in the United States are infected with Chagas disease. Despite published recommendations for healthcare providers, the neglected nature of this disease persists, in part due to gaps in knowledge and low levels of Chagas disease awareness among healthcare providers. A survey was emailed to healthcare providers to assess knowledge of Chagas disease, screening practices, and provider-perceived barriers to screening.  Methods. The survey link was emailed to healthcare providers and department heads. Providers answered a series of questions categorized either as knowledge (K), practice (P), or perceived barriers (B), which were then scored by category. The analysis included Spearmans rho test to measure the strength of the correlation coefficient between K and P scores and between K and B scores, Kruskal-Wallis tests to see if average K, P, and B scores were equal across specialty groups, and Pairwise Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests to assess for a significant difference between average scores of cardiology, infectious disease, and the ""other specialties"" category.  Results. 92 providers consented to complete the survey, 88 of whom fit the inclusion criteria of either affiliation with Yale University or YNHH. Infectious disease scored highest on average in knowledge and practices and reported lower provider-perceived barriers (0.66{+/-}0.183, 0.35{+/-}0.247, 0.42{+/-}0.365). No specialty received higher than 0.66{+/-}0.183 on average for knowledge or screening practices. Average perceived barriers to screening were highest in the ""other"" specialty category (0.76{+/-}0.303). There was a significant positive association between knowledge scores and screening practice scores and a significant negative association between knowledge scores and perceived barriers to screening.  Conclusions. This study revealed a knowledge deficit among healthcare providers in various specialties, which was associated with less frequent adherence to recommended screening practices for Chagas disease, as well as higher provider-perceived barriers to screening. This information can inform provider education initiatives so that patients at risk for Chagas disease may be better served in Connecticut and throughout the United States."

Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have been described as naturally occurring randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, MR often deviates from appropriate RCT design principles and relies heavily on two-sample approaches. We used data from the Million Veteran Program (MVP) to empirically evaluate the impact of study design choices and use of one- versus two-sample MR in a study of lipids and coronary artery disease. Methods. Our MR study included MVP participants of European descent with no history of coronary artery disease or contraindications to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-related therapies. We sequentially modified the eligibility criteria, study duration and follow-up to reflect common study design decisions for MR. In all designs, we used one- and two-sample approaches to estimate 10-year risks of coronary artery disease per 39 mg/dL increase in LDL-C or 15.6 mg/dL increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Results. For LDL-C, one-sample estimates varied across designs (odds ratios from 1.50 [95% CI: 1.34,1.68] to 2.23 [95% CI: 1.93,2.59]) and were most sensitive to the inclusion of prevalent outcome events in the analysis. Odds ratios obtained via two-sample MR were attenuated (1.13 [95% CI: 1.01,1.26] to 1.30 [95% CI: 1.15,1.46]).

It is, however, unknown whether this is also true in the postpartum period where women have a heightened depression risk and are routinely offered to start HC. Objective: To determine if HC initiation postpartum is associated with depression development within 12 months postpartum. Design: A cohort study based on Danish register data. Setting: Nationwide population-based. Participants: All primiparous women in Denmark who gave birth from 1997 through 2022. Women were excluded if they had a depression within 24 months prior to delivery, had multiple birth or stillbirth, or a diagnosis of breast cancer or liver tumor. Exposure: HC initiation within 12 months postpartum treated as a time-varying exposure. HC types were categorized as combined oral contraceptives (COCs), combined non-oral contraceptives (CNOCs), progestogen-only pills (POPs), and progestogen-only non-oral contraceptives (PNOCs). Main Outcome and Measure: Depression defined as filling an antidepressant prescription or receiving a hospital depression diagnosis. Adjusted hazards ratios (HRs) and average absolute risks of depression within 12 months postpartum were estimated using Cox regression and a G-formula estimator. Results: Of 610,038 first-time mothers, 41% initiated HC within 12 months postpartum (mean [SD] age; 27.6 [4.3] years for HC users vs. 29.6 [4.8] years for non-users). HC initiation was associated with subsequent depression with a HR of 1.49 (95% CI, 1.42;1.56) compared to no use resulting in an increase in the 12-month absolute risk from 1.36% (1.32;1.39) to 1.54% (1.50;1.57).The HR for COC was 1.72 (1.63;1.82); CNOC 1.97 (1.64;2.36); PNOC 1.40 (1.25;1.56). POP exposure was associated with an initially reduced instantaneous risk but it was increased late postpartum. Investigating the impact of timing of initiation showed that the earlier COC was initiated postpartum the higher the associated rate ratio of depression. Conclusions and Relevance: HC initiation postpartum was associated with 49% higher instantaneous depression risk resulting in an increase in 12-month risk from 1.36% to 1.54% in the observed population. Such associated risk was higher the earlier it was initiated postpartum, at least for COC. This raises the question if depression incidence postpartum is inflated by routine HC initiation after childbirth."

This study used Cox regression to investigate how socioeconomic inequality in mortality can be explained by exposure to various factors including smoking, diet, alcohol and physical activity. This study seeks to complement and extend previous work which found that the contribution of the socioeconomic gradient to inequalities in health was underestimated by baseline analysis. Methods Data was obtained from Whitehall II, a British longitudinal cohort study, which investigated social determinants of health. Analysis is based on 11 waves of data collected over 32 years on 10,308 civil servants aged between 35 and 90. Socioeconomic position was defined by baseline employment grade (1-3). During the follow-up 2,427 participants died. Extensive experimental analysis was conducted using a vast number of health behaviours. Cox regression produced an age-and-sex-adjusted hazard ratio for the socioeconomic inequality in mortality. Health behaviours (smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and diet) were then added as covariates to determine the extent to which they statistically explain this inequality, and how this differed from the last similar analysis from 2009. This was done at baseline and longitudinally. The health behaviours were then combined linearly, nonlinearly and new health behaviours were added. Results Adding the above health behaviours as covariates statistically explained the socioeconomic gradient in mortality at baseline from 42% to 2009, to 51% to 2021. Longitudinal consideration increased the explanatory power, when all health behaviours were added as time-varying covariates, from 51% to 87%. Adding more variables in the form of a more comprehensive diet score statistically explained the gradient further, to 91%. The nonlinear model of smoking and exercise most accurately predicted mortality and had a 13% higher explanatory power when explaining the gradient compared to the linear model in longitudinal data. Conclusion In the Whitehall II study, socioeconomic position and mortality showed an association. There is a gain in explanatory power of the set of health behaviours at baseline when follow-up is extended by 12 years, from 42% to 51%. When changes in behaviour over the 32 years of follow-up were also accounted for, this association was now significantly explained by over 90%, compared with 51% when considered at baseline. We suggest that reverse causation is partly responsible for the almost complete explanation of the social gradient in mortality by health behaviours. These results would therefore lead us to question why health behaviours are socially patterned in the way that has been observed, which would be significant for targeting health behaviours in lower socioeconomic statuses."

Romney', 'Nancy Matic', 'Christopher F. Lowe']",Christopher F. Lowe (clowe@providencehealth.bc.ca),"[""St. Paul's Hospital""]","Background: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antiviral resistance (AVR) testing is a highly sensitive diagnostic method, able to detect low-level mutant subpopulations. Our clinical virology laboratory previously transitioned from DNA hybridization (INNO-LiPA) to NGS, initially with the GS Junior System and subsequently the MiSeq. The Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing system was evaluated for HBV resistance testing, with regards to sequencing accuracy and turn-around time. Methods: We performed amplicon sequencing of the HBV polymerase gene from patient plasma and external quality assessment (EQA) samples on the MiSeq Reagent Nano Kit v2 and GridION ONT with R10.4.1 flowcells. Mutational analysis and genotyping were performed by DeepChekAssay-HBV (version 2.0). Results: A total of 49 patient samples and 15 EQA samples were tested on both the MiSeq and ONT. There was high agreement for both patient and EQA samples between the MiSeq and ONT systems, with regards to total drug resistance mutations detected and total patient sample agreement, 68/70 (97%) and 47/49 (96%), respectively. Conclusion: The ONT NGS platform provided accurate HBV AVR results, with improved turn-around times. Sequencing error rates at AVR codons were below 1%."
