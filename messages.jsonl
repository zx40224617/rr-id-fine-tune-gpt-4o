However, manual SOFA calculation is time consuming. Thus, we developed an automated real-time SOFA score application that has been fully implemented into the major electronic health record (EHR) system (TakeCare) in Stockholm. We aimed to describe the method and evaluate its performance for detection of sepsis. Method: We developed an automated SOFA application that presents a total score (SOFATotal) over time and a baseline score (SOFAChronic) based on outpatient data prior to hospital admission. We evaluated its performance on 583 sepsis alert patients in an emergency department, including 472 with sepsis according to manually calculated SOFA (SOFAManual). SOFATotal at 30 minutes and 3 hours, and quick-SOFA (qSOFA) were compared with SOFAManual for detection of sepsis. The acute SOFA score (SOFAAcute) was calculated by subtracting SOFAChronic from SOFATotal. Results: SOFATotal at 3 hours showed moderate-good agreement with SOFAManual (R2 = 0.76). Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for sepsis detection were 0.83 at 30 minutes, 0.94 at 3 hours for SOFATotal, and 0.67 for qSOFA. Among patients with SOFAChronic \u22651 (21% of cases), SOFATotal of \u22652 was observed in 90% of cases (mortality 13.5%), although SOFAAcute of \u22652 was noted in 63% (mortality 16.7%). Conclusion: The automated SOFA score demonstrated effectiveness in early sepsis detection, outperforming qSOFA, but adjustments for chronic baseline scores were necessary to avoid over-diagnosis. Further studies on broader patient populations would be useful to validate its clinical use.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

We estimate the epidemiological impact of this SARS-CoV-2 lineage replacement in Brazil and we further assessed the cross-reactive neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients infected during 2023. We analyzed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in Brazil between July 2023 and March 2024. We evaluated the cross-reactive NAb responses to the JN.1 variant in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients, both before and after infection with XBB.1* lineages. JN.1 replaced XBB with similar temporal dynamics across all country regions, though its epidemiological impact varied between locations. The Southeastern, Southern, and Central-Western regions experienced a brief XBB wave around October 2023, shortly before the introduction of JN.1, without any immediate upsurge of SARI cases during viral lineage replacement. By contrast, the Northeastern and Northern regions did not experience an XBB wave in the latter half of 2023 and displayed a rapid surge in SARI cases driven by the emergence of the JN.1. We found that recent XBB infections in the Brazilian population significantly boosted cross-reactive NAb levels against JN.1. The XBB wave observed in the second half of 2023 in some Brazilian states likely acted as a booster for population immunity, providing short-term protection against JN.1 infections and delaying the rise of SARI cases in certain regions of the country.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

The gut microbiome enables protection against diverse pathogens and exhibits dysbiosis during infectious and autoimmune disease. Studies based in the United States and China have found that severe COVID-19 cases have altered gut microbiome composition when compared to mild COVID-19 cases. We present the first study to investigate the gut microbiome composition of COVID-19 cases in a population from Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the impact of geography and cultural traditions on microbiome composition, it is important to investigate the microbiome globally and not draw broad conclusions from homogenous populations. Results: We used stool samples in a Ugandan biobank collected from COVID-19 cases during 2020-2022. We profiled the gut microbiomes of 114 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 along with 76 household contacts who did not present any symptoms of COVID-19. The inclusion of healthy controls enables us to generate hypotheses about bacterial strains potentially related to susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, which is highly heterogeneous. Comparison of the COVID-19 patients and their household contacts revealed decreased alpha diversity and blooms of Enterococcus and Eggerthella in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our study finds that the microbiome of COVID-19 individuals is more likely to be disrupted, as indicated by decreased diversity and increased pathobiont levels. This is either a consequence of the disease or may indicate that certain microbiome states increase susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Our findings enable comparison with cohorts previously published in the Global North, as well as support new hypotheses about the interaction between the gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

Antimalarial medications differ in their efficacy in clearing the transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum (gametocytes) and in preventing mosquito infection. Here we present a combined analysis of six trials conducted at the same study site with highly consistent methodologies that allows for a direct comparison of the gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities of fifteen different antimalarial regimens or dosing schedules. Methods and findings Between January 2013 and January 2023, six clinical trials with transmission endpoints were conducted at the Clinical Research Centre of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako in Mali. These trials tested Artemisinin-Combination Therapies (ACTs), non-ACT regimens and combinations with 8-aminoquinolines. Participants were males and non-pregnant females, between 5-50 years of age, who presented with P. falciparum mono-infection and gametocyte carriage by microscopy. Blood samples were taken before and after treatment for thick film microscopy, infectivity assessments by mosquito feeding assays and molecular quantification of gametocytes. Mixed-effects generalized linear models were fit with individual-specific random effects and fixed effects for time points, treatment groups and their interaction. Models quantified changes in mosquito infection rates and gametocyte densities within treatment arms over time and between treatments. In a pooled analysis of 422 participants, we observed substantial differences between ACTs in gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities, with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) being significantly more potent at reducing mosquito infection rates within 48 hours than dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and pyronaridine-artesunate (PY-AS) (p<0.0001). The addition of single low dose primaquine (SLD PQ) accelerated gametocyte clearance and led to a significantly greater reduction in mosquito infection rate within 48-hours of treatment for each ACT, while an SLD of the 8-aminoaquinoline tafenoquine (TQ) showed a delayed but effective response compared to SLD primaquine. Finally, our findings confirmed considerably higher post-treatment transmission after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP-AQ) compared to most ACTs, with a significantly lower relative reduction in mosquito infection rate at day 7 compared to DHA-PPQ, AS-AQ, and AL (p<0.0001). Therefore, adding an SLD PQ to SP-AQ may be beneficial to block malaria transmission in community treatment campaigns. Conclusions We found marked differences among ACTs and single low-dose 8-aminoquinoline drugs in their ability and speed to block transmission. The findings from this analysis can support treatment policy decisions for malaria elimination and be integrated into mathematical models to improve the accuracy of predictions regarding community transmission and the spread of drug resistance under varying treatment guidelines.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "yes"}]}

This study aimed to elucidate the pathogenic factors of severe Gleich syndrome through comprehensive multi-omics analysis, including whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). A young female patient (age: 16-20 years old) presenting with periodic high fever, extensive urticaria/eczema, and marked eosinophilia was diagnosed with Gleich syndrome. The symptoms were severe, with no spontaneous remission, but responded well to oral steroids, showing mild resolution. WGS analysis of the patient's blood samples identified high-impact pathogenic mutations in 16 genes, including PRDM16. RNA-seq analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with immune response regulation and viral defense. Combined z-score analysis of WGS and RNA-seq data identified ACE as a key gene. ACE expression was markedly downregulated during disease progression and recovered with treatment. IFNG was also identified. The results of this study suggest that a marked decrease in ACE, driven by genetic mutations in PRDM16 and altered expression of IFNG, leading to increased bradykinin and enhanced activation of the arachidonic acid cascade, may have caused the clinical presentation of Gleich syndrome, including dramatic inflammation and angioedema.

Recent studies in mice uncovered a potential underlying mechanism of placebo effects, by demonstrating the involvement of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, previously implicated in reward expectation, in immune modulation. Yet, it is not known whether an analogous brain-immune regulatory mechanism exists in humans, and whether it employs conscious positive expectations. Here, we employed fMRI-neurofeedback to train healthy participants to increase their reward mesolimbic activity by using self-chosen mental strategies, followed by Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) vaccination. We found that stronger Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) activity, but not control regions activation, was associated with higher post-vaccination HBV antibody titer. Interestingly, higher VTA activity before vaccination was associated with mental strategies characterized by positive expectation.

In Sweden, the yearly incidence is between 1000 and 1500 people, which is higher than the global average. Understanding the economic burden of suicide could help highlight the importance and urgency of finding more effective treatments and preventative measures to help people suffering from suicidal thoughts and support studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various interventions. Method: This national population-based cross-sectional study estimated the indirect costs associated with all suicides in Sweden between 2010 and 2019. Indirect costs were estimated using the human capital approach. Data regarding average salaries and employment rates were extracted from publicly available data in Sweden. Productivity loss was estimated over two time horizons, the year following the suicide and over a lifetime horizon. Estimations were performed in total numbers for the yearly cohorts as well as per person. Results: Between 2010 and 2019, 1 406 to 1 591 suicides occurred every year in Sweden. In total, approximately 26 500 productive life years are lost every year due to suicide. In 2019, the productivity loss due to all suicides in Sweden was estimated to be 44 million euros over a one-year time horizon, where 10 million euros are direct losses in local and regional authority taxes. Over a lifetime, productivity losses amounted to 935 million euros. The corresponding estimations per person were 37 and 778 thousand euros respectively over a one-year and a lifetime time horizon Over a one-year time horizon, the productivity loss was highest in the older age groups. Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the economic burden of suicide on Swedish society.

Self-collection of rectal specimens is widely used globally, but limited data exist on its implementation in Africa. We report experiences of MSM/TGW self-collecting rectal STI specimens in Kigali. Methods From March to August 2018, 738 MSM/TGW were recruited in a cross-sectional study using respondent-driven sampling in Kigali. We tested for Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis using the Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG platform on self-collected rectal swabs. Likert scales assessed self-collection difficulty and comfort. Ordered logistic regression analyses were performed to characterize factors associated with self-collection difficulty. Results Overall, 14%(106) identified as TGW. In total, 78%(577) found rectal swab self-collection easy/very easy, while 15%(108) found it difficult/very difficult.
