AimTo examine the treatments and recommendations of GPs for adolescent patients with depression and/or anxiety in Australia, their referral practices to specialist care and estimated wait times for these, and the perceived impact of long wait times on GPs, their patients and their treatment.  Design, Setting and MethodsAn online survey of 192 GPs in Australia who treated adolescents (12 to 17 years old) with depression and/or anxiety.  ResultsGPs frequently referred adolescents with depression and/or anxiety to psychologists. The estimated wait time for psychologists (M: 57 days, SD: 47.9) was four times the proposed acceptable wait time (M: 16.7 days, SD: 27.0). The frequency of medication prescribing almost doubled during the wait time when compared to routine practice (14.6% versus 8.3%, respectively). Almost all GPs (81.8%) increased their level of care due to long wait times but had limited training in youth mental health and knowledge on appropriate strategies to do so effectively.  ConclusionThe findings signify the discrepancies between the preferences of GPs for treatment availability in Australia and what they see as the experience for many adolescents with depression and/or anxiety who are referred to specialist care. Greater training, improved communication between referrer and referred services, and digital interventions may help GPs to reduce the negative impacts of long wait times on their adolescent patients."

This study focuses on aiding genetic discovery in depression by revisiting the depressed phenotype and developing a quantitative trait in a large mixed family and population study, using analyses built upon the theory which underpins Mendels pleiotropic observations - the relationship between phenotypic variation and genetic variation.  Measures of genetic covariation were used to evaluate and rank ten measures of mood, personality, and cognitive ability as endophenotypes for depression. The highest-ranking traits were subjected to principal component analysis, and the first principal component used to create multivariate measures of depression.  Four traits fulfilled most endophenotype criteria, however, only two traits (neuroticism and the general health questionnaire) consistently ranked highest across all measures of covariation. As such, three composite traits were derived incorporating two, three, or four traits.  Composite traits were compared to the binary classification of depression and to their constituent univariate traits in terms of their coheritability, their ability to identify risk loci in a genome-wide association analysis, and phenotypic variance explained by polygenic profile scores for depression.  Association analyses of binary depression, univariate traits, and composite traits yielded no genome-wide significant results. However, composite traits were more heritable and more highly correlated with depression than their constituent traits, suggesting that analysing candidate endophenotypes in combination captures more of the heritable component of depression and may in part be limited by sample size in the current study."

However, its neural underpinnings remain poorly understood because functional neuroimaging studies have produced disparate findings. Here, we tackled this lack of replication by investigating whether peak coordinates of studies on psychopathy could in fact map onto a common functional connectivity network. An updated meta-analysis of 23 functional neuroimaging studies (534 cases vs 594 controls) first revealed no significant regional spatial convergence. However, using functional connectomes of 1,000 healthy participants, we demonstrated that the heterogeneous study findings do indeed converge onto a common brain network with a replicability reaching up to 85.2% across studies. We subsequently showed strong associations between this Psychopathy Network and a lesion network of 17 lesion sites causally linked to antisocial behaviors, as well as its association with neurotransmission systems and genetic markers previously implicated in the pathophysiology of psychopathy. Taken together, our study highlights the importance of examining the neural correlates of psychopathy from a network perspective, which can be validated using a multilevel approach, encompassing neural, genetic and neurochemical data. Ultimately, this approach may pave the way for novel and more personalised treatments."

Systems immunology studies have been applied to human cohort studies to better understand these effects, but most are performed in Western populations of mostly European ancestry, neglecting the vast majority of human global diversity. To overcome this limitation, we established the Healthy Human Global Project - Hong Kong (HHGP-HK) cohort to allow the study of immune variability in a healthy Asian population. Taking inspiration from the established French Milieu Interieur study we adapted inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify healthy donors, and to facilitate cross comparison between the two cohorts we collected similar demographic, medical and lifestyle information. To study the effects of age and sex, donors were stratified for both ranging from 20-79 years. We report here significant age and sex effects on multiple clinical laboratory measures, many of which were consistently observed in the Milieu Interieur cohort. C-reactive protein and liver enzymes were two exceptions perhaps reflecting different environmental effects between the two cohorts. We applied biological aging, physiological, and mental health scores to our cohort which highlights the need to develop and adapt such scores for application to populations of non-European descent. We also included wearable fitness trackers from which we observed significant age and sex differences for sleep, physical activity, and heart rate variability. This unique cohort will enable the better understanding of factors that determine immune variability within Asian populations."

How much time is necessary for such learning? Comparisons with time requirements for other skills make it plausible that for many people, learning anger control may require well over 100 hours of time on task. Research interventions have been shorter -- a mean of 9 sessions was reported in one meta-analysis. In this study, our goal was to examine how much psychotherapeutic intervention is being delivered in the ""real world"" to patients with Intermittent Explosive Disorder.  MethodWe studied a de-identified electronic health record data from TriNetX, collected from 87 medical institutions. We studied 32,322 individuals with Intermittent Explosive Disorder. We examined the distribution of the number of individuals across numbers of sessions received.  ResultsThe distribution for the numbers of sessions is highly skewed, resembling a curve of inverse proportion, or a Pareto function. The mode and the median were zero. Only about 25% of patients received any psychotherapy. For that subset, the median was 5 sessions, and the mean was 16. Approximately 10% received 9 visits or more; 5% 30 or more; 2% 50 or more. A large fraction of the psychotherapeutic labor was devoted to a small fraction of the patients: 80% of the sessions went to 7.5% of the patients.  ConclusionsThe ability of health care systems to reduce the societal problem of aggression, at least by psychotherapeutic intervention, appears limited by the factors leading to low, or no, time on task."

To approach a solution for this clinical need, we sequenced microRNAs of urinary extracellular vesicles and performed biomarker discovery by small RNA sequencing in a type 1 diabetes cohort including males with and without albuminuria. The results were replicated by sequencing or qPCR in two independent cohorts and four previously published datasets including type 1 and 2 diabetes as well as both sexes. Non-diabetic and prostate cancer cohorts were used as additional controls and miRNAs changed due to preanalytical urine collection variables were excluded. Using these data, we additionally validated previously identified reference candidate miRNAs. Correlations with clinical parameters, receiver operating characteristic analysis, targeted mRNAs and pathways including integrated single cell data, and targeted circulating proteins from type 1 and 2 diabetes cohorts were analyzed. We pinpointed 6 stable microRNAs, 11 differentially expressed microRNAs, 9 target proteins and 16 DKD-associated pathways in individuals with diabetic kidney disease. Replication showed that the differentially expressed miRNAs in DKD were partly shared between diabetes subtypes and sexes with overall strongest evidence for miR-192-5p, miR-146a-5p, miR-486-5p, and miR-574-5p. Combination of these miRNAs with clinical variables showed potential to classify individuals with the fastest kidney function decline (sensitivity 0.75-1.00 and specificity 0.83-1.00) even in the normoalbuminuria group, thus holding the potential as early diagnostic markers. Altogether, the candidate microRNAs show specificity for diabetic kidney disease, identify declining kidney function, and target key kidney cell types, mRNAs, proteins, and pathogenic mechanisms.  Lay summaryDiabetic kidney disease (DKD) damages the kidneys severely. DKD progression differs between diabetes subtypes and sexes and currently the diagnosis comes too late when the kidney is already damaged. Thus, clinical care needs better and earlier diagnostic markers. Here we studied the microRNAs in urinary extracellular vesicles, small particles secreted actively by the kidney cells. We found 11 candidate microRNA markers for DKD. The discovery was made in males with type 1 diabetes, but some of the microRNAs were confirmed across type 1 and 2 diabetes, as well as female or combined sex populations. Altogether we studied over 250 samples. Analysis of miRNAs regulatory pathways and correlations with clinical measurements in individuals with DKD suggest that some miRNAs may hold the potential as early diagnostic markers. Our findings could thus impact clinical practice by providing early and specific DKD diagnostic tools allowing effective care at an early DKD stage."

However, its safety and feasibility in stroke patients remains unknown. Intensity is a critical safety parameter for LIFUS. We aimed to determine the maximum safe and tolerable intensity of LIFUS in stroke patients, and to explore its effect on upper-extremity motor learning and corticospinal excitability.  METHODSSubjects with first-ever stroke participated in this Phase I study. We adopted the classic 3+3 dose-escalation paradigm to sham/0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 W/cm2 spatial-peak pulse-average intensity (ISPPA, estimated in-vivo transcranial value; LOW: sham/0, 1 and 2 W/cm2, HIGH: 4, 6 and 8 W/cm2). Stopping rules (dose limiting toxicities) were pre-defined: [&ge;]2nd-degree scalp burn, clinical seizures, [&ge;]20% topical apparent diffusion coefficient change, or participant discontinuation due to any reason. A 12-minute LIFUS was applied over the ipsilesional motor cortex while participants were concurrently practicing three blocks of motor sequence learning (MSL) task using the affected hand. We collected the occurrences of pre-defined adverse events, post-minus-pre improvements in MSL response time, and post-minus-pre differences in corticospinal excitability quantified by motor evoked potentials.  RESULTSISPPA was escalated to 8 W/cm2 with eighteen stroke participants without meeting stopping rules. Compared to the LOW, the HIGH performed significantly better on the MSL (24.7{+/-}13.3% vs. 13.2{+/-}10.9%, p=0.01). Similarly, the HIGH also showed signs of increased corticospinal excitability (32.0{+/-}34.3% vs. 12.9{+/-}48.0%) but did not reach significance, p=0.53.  CONCLUSIONSOur Phase I safety study suggests that a single session of 12-minute LIFUS up to 8 W/cm2 ISPPA is safe and feasible in stroke patients. Higher LIFUS intensities can induce greater MSL retention. The next logical step is to conduct a Phase II study to further test the efficacy of LIFUS and monitor its safety profiles in stroke patients.

Our findings highlight a multifactorial etiology and neurobiology of IED, emphasizing the role of the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex in emotional regulation and impulse control, and supporting interventions that target serotonergic signaling. Research also shows that childhood trauma and adverse family environment may significantly contribute to the development of IED. Yet, genetic studies focusing on IED were largely lacking, despite many examining the genetics underlying aggression as a general trait or other related disorders. Future research using consistently defined IED as a phenotype is required to better understand the etiology and underlying mechanisms and assist in informing the development of more effective interventions for IED."

Even when effective vaccines became available, many communities remained at high risk of surges in COVID-19-related hospitalizations due to waning immunity, low uptake of booster vaccinations, and the continual emergence of new variations of SARS-CoV-2. Some risk metrics, such as the CDCs Community Levels, were developed to predict the impact of COVID-19 on the community-level healthcare system based on routine surveillance data. However, they had limited utility as they were not routinely updated based on accumulating data and were not directly linked to specific outcomes, such as surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations beyond local capacities. Regression models could resolve these limitations, but they have limited interpretability and do not convey the reasoning behind their predictions. In this paper, we evaluated decision tree classifiers that were developed in ""real-time"" to predict surges in local hospitalizations due to COVID-19 between July 2020 and November 2022. These classifiers would have provided visually intuitive and interpretable decision rules for local decision-makers to understand and act upon, and by being updated weekly, would have responded to changes in the epidemic. We showed that these classifiers exhibit reasonable predictive ability with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (auROC) > 80%. These classifiers maintained their performance temporally (i.e, over the duration of the pandemic) and spatially (i.e., across US counties). We also showed that these classifiers outperformed the CDCs Community Levels for predicting high hospital occupancy.  Significance StatementA major concern during the COVID-19 pandemic was the risk of exceeding local healthcare capacity due to COVID-19-related hospitalizations. To assess this risk and inform mitigating strategies, several risk assessment tools were developed during the pandemic. Many of these tools, however, did not predict local outcomes, were not updated as the pandemic progressed, and/or were not interpretable by decision-makers. We propose an adaptive framework of decision tree classifiers to predict whether COVID-19-related hospital occupancy would exceed a given capacity threshold. This framework would provide interpretable classification rules to predict surges in local hospitalizations,and maintained its performance over time and across US counties, and outperformed the CDCs Community Level tool."

LLMs are well-known to produce a variety of errors. Currently, there is no established clinical framework for assessing the safety and accuracy of LLM-generated medical text.  We have developed a new approach to: a) categorise LLM errors within the clinical documentation context, b) establish clinical safety metrics for the live usage phase, and c) suggest a framework named CREOLA for assessing the safety risk for errors. We present clinical error metrics over 18 different LLM experimental configurations for the clinical note generation task, consisting of 12,999 clinician-annotated sentences. We illustrate the utility of using our platform CREOLA for iteration over LLM architectures with two experiments. Overall, we find our best- performing experiments outperform previously reported model error rates in the note generation literature, and additionally outperform human annotators. Our suggested framework can be used to assess the accuracy and safety of LLM output in the clinical context."

Severe CAC (sCAC) poses a formidable challenge to interventional surgery and exhibits robust associations with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative to develop tools capable of early-stage detection and risk assessment for both CAC and sCAC. This study aims to develop and validate nomograms for the accurate prediction of CAC and sCAC.  MethodsThis retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in Taizhou, Jiangsu Province, China. CAC assessment was performed using non-gated thoracic CT scans. Demographic data and clinical information were collected from patients who were then randomly divided into a training set (70%) or a validation set (30%). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression as well as multiple logistic regression analyses were utilized to identify predictive factors for both CAC and sCAC development. Nomograms were developed to predict the occurrence of CAC or sCAC events. The models performance was evaluated through discrimination analysis, calibration analysis, as well as assessment of their clinical utility.  ResultsThis study included 666 patients with an average age of 75 years, of whom 56% were male. 391 patients had CAC, with sCAC in 134 cases. Through LASSO and multiple logistic regression analysis, age increase, hypertension, carotid artery calcification, CHD, and CHADS2 score were identified for the CAC risk predictive nomogram with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.845(95%CI 0.809-0.881) in the training set and 0.810(95%CI 0.751-0.870) in the validation set. Serum calcium level, carotid artery calcification, and CHD were identified for the sCAC risk predictive nomogram with an AUC of 0.863(95%CI 0.825-0.901) in the training set and 0.817(95%CI 0.744-0.890) in the validation set. Calibration plots indicated that two models exhibited good calibration ability. According to the decision curve analysis (DCA) results, both models have demonstrated a positive net benefit within a wide range of risks.  ConclusionsThe present study has successfully developed and validated two nomograms to accurately predict CAC and sCAC, both of which have demonstrated robust predictive capabilities."

Evidence of efficacy for many conditions is however decidedly mixed, with starkly different outcomes reported by different authors. Due to the wide range of irradiances and wavelengths used, interpretation, comparison, and even efficacy evaluation is often impossible or prohibitive, impeding evidence synthesis. This work establishes a framework for objectively cross-comparing patient dose in terms of fluence, and a model for contrasting received dose to typical solar dose at ground level to facilitate interpretation of results and evidence synthesis. This allowes direct cross-comparison of patient skin fluence from LED PMB treatments under different regimes, and a means for evidence synthesis. This was applied to LED PMB data from 27 clinical trials to examine fluences and patient-equivalent solar exposure from LED light-sources for dermatological conditions, including acne vulgaris, wrinkle-reduction, wound-healing, psoriasis severity, and erythemal index. The results of this analysis suggest that fluences, wavelengths, and solar exposure equivalent differed by orders of magnitude in he studies analysed, with effective doses often comparable to typical daily solar exposure. Better dose quantification and plausible biological justification for various wavelengths and fluences are imperative if LED therapy studies for dermatology are to be informative and research replicability improved."

This paper focuses on how acceptable Long COVID services were to paediatric patients.  DesignThis study was explorational. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 13 paediatric patients were used to understand the experiences of patients with Long COVID.  SettingParticipants were recruited from specialist paediatric services in the Southwest of England from June 2022 to September 2023.  PatientsParticipants were children and young people (CYP) aged 11-17 years old with a Long COVID diagnosis who accessed the specialist services in the Southwest of England.  ResultsFour themes were reported. Accessing specialist clinics helped CYP to feel validated, they appreciated consulting with clinicians who were knowledgeable about Long COVID and empathetic. CYP found comfort in knowing other CYP were experiencing Long COVID. CYP wanted to be proactive in their Long COVID management, appreciating regular appointments and the opportunity to learn about their condition. CYP desired normality, and therefore sought flexible appointment times, online appointments, and reasonable adjustments. CYP found the waiting times to access Long COVID services were too long.  ConclusionsOur results stress the importance to CYP of several features of the care received in the specialist clinics. These relate to the experiences of CYP with Long COVID but potentially extend to CYP with other conditions, particularly long-term and/or poorly understood conditions. The results support creating community-based support groups for CYP with long-term medical conditions, providing online flexible appointments, offering early reasonable adjustments for school and providing quicker access to specialist clinics.  Key messages/Summary boxO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSThe existing literature which explores adult experiences of Long COVID services is in agreement with this study in multiple ways. Firstly, it appears that clinician validation is very important to the clinician patient relationship (1-5). Peer support and building a Long COVID community for patients is also valued by individuals with Long COVID (1, 3, 5, 6), as are online appointments (1,3). Finally, long waiting lists to access Long COVID clinics are a barrier to care (1, 3). This can be mitigated to some extent by providing sign-posting or self-management resources while waiting for clinic access (3). However, the literature regarding paediatric experiences of Long COVID is limited. Two papers discuss the impact of a lack of reasonable adjustments on school (7,8) and the importance of validation through peer support (7).  What this study addsTo the best of our knowledge, there are no studies on Long COVID services for paediatric patients that highlight how patients experienced management of their condition. Our study highlights the patients desire to be proactive in their management, including being given opportunities to learn about Long COVID.  How this study might affect research, practice or policyThis study highlights recommendations for clinical practice. It is recommended to consider the following when designing specialist paediatric services for CYP with Long COVID: CYP with complex medical conditions want clinicians to validate their experience by acknowledging that their symptoms are real and their concerns are valid. Community-based groups for CYP experiencing the same condition are valued by patients, as are online flexible appointments, liaison with schools to provide early reasonable adjustments and rapid access to services for CYP. Future research should explore how these recommendations positively impact patients."

Better understanding of comor-bidities will allow for enhanced screening, diagnosis, and treatment of patients.  ObjectiveTo investigate prevalence and associations of IED with psychiatric, neurological, and somatic disorders using real-world data  DesignMatched cohorts of patients with or without IED diagnosis were identified using data from the TriNetX Research Network (until January 31, 2024). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate and compare the probabilities of acquiring other diagnoses using pa-tients available medical records.  SettingAnalysis of electronic medical records from two patient populations.  Participants30,357 individuals with IED and equal number of demographically matched individuals without IED from the TriNetX Research.  ExposureIED diagnosis identified through the associated ICD codes.  Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcomes were ICD-10-CM diagnostic categories and root codes for disorders and health conditions in both cohorts. Main measures are total numbers and proportions of patients who had the diagnostic codes, as well as adjusted hazard ratios for IED diagnosis.  ResultsAlthough only 0.03% of the total patient population had an IED diagnosis, we found extensive and widespread comorbidities with psychiatric, neurological and somatic conditions. A significant 95.7% of the individuals with IED had another psychiatric diagnosis. All psychiatric sub-categories and 95% of the psychiatric diagnoses were significantly associated with IED, with HRs ranging from 2 to 77. Among neurological conditions, neurodegenerative diseases and epilepsy had the highest HRs, followed by extrapyramidal and movement disorders, cerebral palsy and other paralytic syndromes, and sleep disorders. Notable associations with IED also includes conditions such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and GERD.  Conclusion and RelevanceOur findings illuminate the extensive comorbid relationships between IED and psychiatric, neurological, and somatic disorders. This underscores the necessity for an integrated diagnostic and treatment approach that addresses both the psychological and physical health aspects of IED. Additionally, our work highlights the need for more accurate and inclusive diagnosis of IED in patients with mental disorders.  Key PointsFocused Question: What is the pattern of comorbidity of IED with other disorders?  Findings: Despite being underdiagnosed in the clinical cohort, IED was found significantly associated with a wide range of psychiatric disorders, many neurological, and some somatic disorders.  Meaning: The widespread comorbidity highlights the critical need for integrated care approaches that consider the multifaceted health challenges faced by individuals with IED."

Psychosis, which includes hallucinations and delusions, occurs in up to 50% of people with dementia and has been linked with lower quality of life and faster cognitive decline. While best practice guidelines have highlighted the importance of non-pharmacological treatments for NPS, evidence-based non-pharmacological approaches are limited. This exploratory analysis of a cluster randomized control trial (RCT) from the WHELD programme compares the WHELD/Brief Psychosocial Therapy intervention with treatment as usual in a 9-month trial across 69 UK nursing homes (N=8477, 553 completed). The current report analyzed outcomes for the participants with dementia-related psychosis (N=163) participating in the trial. Whilst the WHELD/Brief Psychosocial Therapy intervention did not significantly reduce NPI psychosis score, it did significantly improve apathy (p=0.006), agitation (p=0.038) and quality of life (p=0.01) in participants with psychosis. In addition there was a non-significant numerical improvement in caregiver perceived disruptiveness. These findings suggest that whilst the WHELD/ Brief Psychosocial Therapy intervention does not directly alleviate psychosis in people with dementia, it does significantly improve related neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life, offering meaningful benefits to people with dementia experiencing distressing psychotic symptoms."

As the foundation for lifelong mental health is established during childhood and adolescence, early prevention and treatment of mental health problems, such as through psychotherapy, are crucial. In Germany, current outpatient psychotherapeutic care capacities appear inadequate, while systematic evaluations of the care situation are lacking. This study investigates the state of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany and evaluates various methodological approaches for its assessment. We conducted a scoping review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Publications from January 2018 to December 2023 were sourced from PubPsych, PubMed, APA PsycInfo, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. Included studies reported quantitative primary data on the mental health of community samples of children and adolescents in Germany or their outpatient psychotherapeutic care. We included 41 publications comprising epidemiological studies, administrative data, and psychotherapist and patient reports. A lack of systematic and standardized research approaches resulted in significant variance in data. Nonetheless, qualitative analysis revealed that approximately one four children and adolescents in Germany is affected by mental health problems, while one in six to seven children and adolescents requires psychotherapeutic treatment. Yet, only up to one in fifty receives guideline-based psychotherapy. Most requests for initial psychotherapeutic consultations are unmet, with waiting times for guideline-based psychotherapy exceeding six months for at least half of the patients. Overall, our findings suggest that outpatient psychotherapeutic care for children and adolescents in Germany is still insufficient. They advocate for a systematic, multimodal, and longitudinal assessment of statutory health insurance-funded outpatient psychotherapeutic care, along with an expansion of treatment capacities to enhance access for children and adolescents in Germany."

This protocol is designed to provide guidance for public health professionals and researchers in the development of future KAP studies by ensuring uniformity in design and structure. This manuscript describes a rigorous three-phase protocol for the development of standardized vector-borne disease survey modules that can be used throughout the United States to generate data that are comparable across diverse regions. During phase one, a workshop with subject matter experts and a comprehensive literature review will be conducted to identify survey domains and generate items of interest. Survey items will also be mapped based on two theoretical frameworks, the Health Belief Model and the Risks, Attitudes, Norms, Abilities and Self-Regulation framework, to help gauge individual perceptions of risk severity and self-efficacy. During phase two, a group of expert judges will evaluate survey items based on content relevance, representativeness, and technical quality. During the final phase, cognitive interviews and surveys with target audience groups will be conducted to ensure the face validity of the modules.

MethodsData were analyzed from the prospective Cincinnati Cohort Biomarkers Program. The primary outcome of interest was daytime sleepiness, as measured by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). The primary exposure variable was orthostatic hypotension (OH) with a sub-analysis for the neurogenic OH (nOH) subtype. Regression analyses were carried out adjusting for the following covariates: age, sex, disease duration, education, comorbidities, anti-cholinergic burden, levodopa equivalent dose (LEDD), motor subscore of the Movement disorder society-unified Parkinsons disease rating scale, Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&Y), Beck Depression Inventory, and Beck Anxiety Inventory.

Leak is highly variable, pressure dependent and often unrecognised. The effectiveness of resuscitation devices to deliver adequate inflations in the presence of leak is unknown. Bench models simulating continuous leak have disadvantages of not accurately reflecting leak occurring during clinical resuscitation. A dynamic leak model based on pressure release valves was thus developed.  AimTo assess self-inflating bag (SIB) and T-piece resuscitator (TPR) ventilation performance in the presence of dynamic (DLM) compared to continuous (CLM) leak models in a bench study.  MethodFive predefined leak levels were tested for each leak model (0-87%). Resuscitation devices were connected to a test lung (compliance 0.6 mL/cmH2O) and respiratory parameters were measured using respiratory function monitors before (patient interface) and after (actual) an induced leak at 40, 60, 80 inflations/min.  Results3,600 inflations were analysed. DLM showed a decrease in actual tidal volumes from 0%-87% leak with tidal volume differences (SIB 4.8mL, TPR 2.9mL), contrasting to minimal change for CLM (SIB -0.6mL, TPR 0.3mL). CLM demonstrated larger differences between patient interface and actual leak. The absolute difference at 60 inflations/min at 87% leak were SIB 37.5%, TPR 18.2% for CLM compared to SIB 4.6%, TPR 1.4% for DLM.  ConclusionCLM may underestimate the impact of resuscitation device performance with poor correlation between patient interface and actual delivered volume. DLM demonstrates several advantages with more accurate representation of face mask leak and will prove useful in modelling all systems delivering PPV.  O_LIWhat is already known on this topic? - Mask leak is common, variable and often unrecognised during newborn resuscitation. - Excessive or insufficient tidal volumes may cause newborn lung and brain injury. - Current leak models used to test ventilation devices have a poor fidelity in modelling clinical mask leak.

C_LIO_LIHow this study might affect research, practice or policy? - The use of dynamic leak model as a higher fidelity simulation tool for the testing of not only resuscitation devices but also ventilators and RFMs. - Further research will determine the ability of currently used ventilation devices to perform in the presence of dynamic leak.

Pharmacological interventions to combat psychotic symptoms have shown limited efficacy and can be associated with significant adverse events. Non-pharmacological interventions are recommended as the first line option for treatment, however there is a paucity of evidence for specific non-pharmacological options to primarily target psychotic symptoms in people with dementia. Further work is needed to identify, adapt and develop possible non-pharmacological options to target psychotic symptoms in dementia.  AimTo establish which non-pharmacological interventions could be used or adapted to treat psychotic symptoms and/or confer benefits in people with dementia  DesignModified Delphi consensus process. Two rounds of feedback were conducted and included a directed scoping review, based on the interventions recommended in the first round of the Delphi.  ParticipantsAn expert panel consisted of 12 members with clinical and research expertise in managing psychotic symptoms in people with dementia  ResultsThere were three top nominated treatment options: cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), family intervention, and personalized activities/environmental/sensory interventions, without a clear priority between the 3 approaches.  The WHELD/Brief Psychosocial Therapy programme focussing on personalized activities improves concurrent neuropsychiatric symptoms in people with dementia related psychosis. Preliminary studies also suggest that combining personalized activities with family training may improve the direct impact on psychosis. There are also opportunities to adapt CBT interventions for people with psychosis related to early or mild dementia.  ConclusionsThere were clear recommendations for three non-pharmacological options that could be used or adapted to benefit people with psychosis in the context of dementia."

Little is known about sedative-hypnotic effects on NREM slow oscillations (SO) and spindles, including their coupling, which is crucial for memory, especially in the elderly.  ObjectivesOur objective was to investigate the effect of chronic sedative-hypnotic use on sleep macro-architecture, EEG relative power, as well as SO and spindle characteristics and coupling.  MethodsOne hundred and one individuals (66.05 {+/-} 5.84 years, 73% female) completed a one-night study and were categorized into three groups: good sleepers (GS, n=28), individuals with insomnia (INS, n=26) or individuals with insomnia who chronically use either BZD or BZRA to manage their insomnia difficulties (MED, n=47; dose equivalent in Diazepam: 6.1 {+/-} 3.8 mg/week). We performed a comprehensive comparison of sleep architecture, EEG relative spectrum, and associated brain oscillatory activities, focusing on NREM brain oscillations crucial for sleep-dependent memory consolidation (i.e., SO and spindles) and their temporal coupling.  ResultsChronic use of BZD/BZRA worsened sleep architecture and spectral activity compared to older adults with and without insomnia disorder. The use of BZD/BZRAs also altered the characteristics of sleep-related brain oscillations and their synchrony. An exploratory interaction model suggested that BZD use exacerbated sleep alterations compared to BZRA, and higher BZD/BZRA dosage worsened alteration in sleep micro-architecture and EEG spectrum.  ConclusionsOur results suggest that chronic use of sedative-hypnotics is detrimental to sleep when compared to drug-free GS and INS. Such alteration of sleep regulation - at the macro and micro-architectural levels - may contribute to the reported association between sedative-hypnotic use and cognitive impairment in older adults.  STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWidespread use of sedative-hypnotics is driven by high insomnia rates among older adults. Chronic use can disrupt sleep and cognitive function, however, its impact on sleep regulation - at the macro and micro-architecture levels - is not well understood. We assessed the effect of chronic sedative-hypnotic use in older adults using a between-group design involving good sleepers, individuals with insomnia disorder who do not take any pharmacological treatment to manage their symptoms and individuals with insomnia disorder who chronically use sedative-hypnotics as a sleep aid. We performed a comprehensive comparison of sleep architecture, EEG relative spectrum, and associated NREM brain oscillations crucial for sleep-dependent memory consolidation (i.e., SO and spindles) and their temporal coupling. We showed that chronic use of sedative-hypnotics is detrimental to sleep regulation - at the macro and micro level - compared to drug-free GS and INS, and this may contribute to the reported link between sedative-hypnotic use and cognitive impairment in older adults."

Menopausal hot flashes typically persist for years. For a sizeable minority of women, hot flashes are severe and substantially impairing. It is worthwhile to further investigate the genetic underpinnings of hot flashes.  MethodWe conducted the largest trans-ancestry genome-wide association study (GWAS) of hot flashes available to date (N=149,560). We used self-assessment of hot flashes in the Nurses Health Study, Nurses Health Study II, Womens Health Initiative, and Queensland Institute of Medical Research samples (total n=42,489). In one sample (UK Biobank, n=107,071) direct assessment of hot flashes was not available, so menopausal hormone therapy was used as a proxy variable. We estimated the heritability of hot flashes and genetic correlations with psychiatric phenotypes using linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSR).  ResultsIn component analyses and our trans-ancestry meta-analysis, the top locus was on chromosome 4 in the neurokinin 3 receptor gene (TACR3, position 104,556,732, trans-ancestry p=7.2x10-41). A second novel locus was identified (LINC02428, p=3.5x10-8). Gene results implicated TACR3, GRID1, NUDT4, and PHF21B. Using the hot flash GWAS meta-analysis (n=42,489; i.e., no proxy variable), SNP heritability was estimated: h2liab=.08 (h2SNP=.04, se=.02). Genetic correlations were statistically significant between hot flashes and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD, rg=0.25, p=0.01), schizophrenia (rg=0.17, p=0.02), and depression (rg=0.21, p=0.01).  DiscussionThese genomic findings are consistent with independent, robust basic science research which led to a novel treatment for hot flashes, namely, neurokinin 3 receptor antagonists. This new class of hot flash drugs blocks the receptor (neurokinin 3 receptor) coded for by the top locus for hot flashes (TACR3). This GWAS of hot flashes provides an uncommonly clear example of how GWAS findings can point to potent treatment targets for complex brain phenotypes. We also found that the proxy variable (menopausal hormone therapy) pointed to the same target (TACR3), and that exclusively intronic and intergenic variants signaled this target."

Our findings show that certain disorders elevate AD and PD risk before AD and PD diagnosis including: insulin and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, noninfective gastro-enteritis and colitis, functional intestinal disorders, and bacterial intestinal infections, among others. Polygenic risk scores revealed lower genetic predisposition to AD and PD in individuals with co-occurring disorders in the study categories, underscoring the importance of regulating the gut-brain axis to potentially prevent or delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases. The proteomic profile of AD/PD cases was influenced by comorbid endocrine, nutritional, metabolic, and digestive systems conditions.

Whereas IgG is actively transferred up a concentration gradient via the neonatal Fc Receptor (FcRn), maternal IgA and IgM are typically excluded from fetal circulation. Further, not all IgG molecules exhibit the same transfer efficiency, being influenced by subclass, Fab and Fc domain glycosylation, antigen-specificity, and the temporal dynamics of maternal antibody responses. Here, we investigate the phenotypes and functions of maternal and cord blood antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and compare them to those induced by mRNA vaccination, focusing on breadth of antigen recognition and antiviral functions including neutralization and effector function. While cord blood coronavirus-specific antibody functional breadth and potency appeared to be more compromised than binding breadth and potency in both groups, vaccination induced substantially greater function and breadth in cord blood than did natural infection. These functional phenotypes were associated with speciation of the maternal serum repertoires, as some IgG subpopulations were enriched while others were relatively depleted. Relevant to the continued protection of vulnerable populations in the context of a diversifying pathogen, greater breadth was observed for antibody effector functions than for neutralization, and these activities were associated with greater affinity for antigen. This work provides insights into the functional breadth of maternal-fetal antibody responses in the context of novel mRNA vaccines and a recently emerged pathogen that is likely to be a public health burden for the foreseeable future."

To address this gap, we conducted a convergent parallel mixed-methods study with semi-structured interviews and a randomized controlled trial. Our interview data revealed that in human-technology teams, decision-making is influenced by factors before, during, and after interaction. Users tend to rely on technology for information gathering and analysis but remain responsible for information integration and the final decision. Based on these results, we developed a model for technology-assisted self-triage decision-making. Our quantitative results indicate that when using a high-performing SAA, laypeoples decision accuracy improved from 53.2% to 64.5% (OR = 2.52, p < .001). In contrast, decision accuracy remained unchanged when using a LLM (54.8% before vs. 54.2% after usage, p = .79).

The association between mCAs and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), particularly late-onset rheumatoid arthritis (LORA), has not been explored.  MethodsmCAs were detected in peripheral blood samples from two independent Japanese datasets (Set 1:2,107 RA cases and 86,998 controls; Set 2:2,359 RA cases and 86,998 controls). The associations between mCAs and RA were evaluated in each dataset using logistic regression models and meta-analysis. In each dataset, we evaluated the effect sizes of mosaic loss of Y (mLOY) and polygenic risk score (PRS) of RA in males and subsequently performed a meta-analysis. The interaction between mLOY and PRS was assessed. These models were applied separately to RA, LORA, and young-onset RA (YORA).  ResultsmLOY increased significantly in LORA (OR=1.43, P=0.0070).

In Wisconsin, community pharmacists have the authority to provide naltrexone injections. However, they have not been explored as a resource for improving access to this medication for formerly incarcerated individuals. As a first step, the goal of this study was to understand the barriers and facilitators impacting access to community pharmacist-provided injectable naltrexone for this patient population during community reentry period. The researcher conducted semi-structured interviews with 18 individuals representing five stakeholder groups. Deductive and inductive content analysis were used to identify barrier and facilitator categories across the five levels of the Socioecological Model. Overall, participants discussed factors at every level, and many barriers and facilitators confirmed findings from existing literature focused on MOUD access for formerly incarcerated individuals. Participants also identified factors more specific to community pharmacies, including 1) lack of interagency collaboration between pharmacists, prescribers, and correctional facilities and 2) lack of awareness of community pharmacist-provided MOUD services. Future research should explore interventions to address the barriers identified in this study and improve connections between community pharmacists and formerly incarcerated individuals. This work can help ensure that these individuals are given the chance to successfully reintegrate into society."

A transdiagnostic factor for psychopathology is emotion regulation, which is influenced by sex hormones, such as estradiol (E2), across the menstrual cycle on the behavioral and neural level. Whether this is also the case in the antepartum period remains unknown. For the first time, behavioral and neural emotion regulation were investigated in healthy primiparous pregnant females with extremely high E2 levels during the second trimester (N = 15) using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Results were compared with naturally-cycling females with high E2 levels (after E2-administration, N = 16) and low E2 levels (early follicular phase, N = 16). Although pregnant females reported the lowest trait use of cognitive reappraisal, all females successfully regulated their emotions by applying cognitive reappraisal in the scanner. On the neural level, all females had increased activity in the left middle frontal gyrus during downregulation of negative emotions. Pregnant females showed no significant differences in functional connectivity (psychophysiological interaction, resting-state) related to emotion regulation compared to the nonpregnant group. However, group differences emerged for amygdala activation. In pregnant females, increased amygdala activity predicted reduced regulation success and was positively associated with depression scores. This first fMRI study during pregnancy indicates that depression scores are reflected in heightened amygdala activity already observable in the antepartum period. Thus, through its association with reduced regulation success, increased amygdala activity suggests a neural risk marker for peripartum mental health. Future research needs to investigate emotion regulation in pregnant and postpartum women to further understand pregnancy-related changes and associations of mood, emotional and neural functions. Eventually, this will allow enhanced identification, prevention, and treatment of peri- and postpartum mental ill-health."

Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and inflammatory proteins may contribute to the development of FM.  ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationships between gut microbiota, inflammatory proteins (cytokines/chemokines), and FM using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) and meta-analysis approaches.  MethodsMR analyses were conducted using genetic data from European populations, employing methods such as MR-IVW, MR-Egger, and MR-weighted median. Reverse MR was also performed, with FM treated as the exposure. A meta-analysis was conducted to consolidate the findings.  ResultsRuminococcus gauvreauii was identified as a risk factor for FM, while Enterorhabdus, Parabacteroides, Butyricicoccus, and Prevotella 9 were found to be protective. Five inflammatory proteins--C-X-C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), S100-A12, Leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR), Monocyte chemoattractant protein 2 (MCP-2/CCL8), and Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-)--exhibited protective associations, while Natural killer cell receptor 2B4 (NKCR-2B4/CD244) and Interleukin-12 subunit beta (IL-12{beta}) were associated with an increased risk of FM.

Respondents completed the American Conspiratorial Thinking Scale (ACTS) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Survey-weighted regression models were used to examine sociodemographic and clinical associations with ACTS score, and associations with vaccination status.  ResultsAcross the 6 survey waves, there were 123,781 unique individuals. After reweighting, a total of 78.6% of respondents somewhat or strongly agreed with at least one conspiratorial idea; 19.0% agreed with all four of them.

Definitions of oscillatory slowing are imprecise, as they average across time and frequency bands, masking the finer structure in the signal and potential reliable biomarkers of the disease.  Recent studies show that high averaged band power can result from transient increases in power, termed  events or  bursts. To better understand MEG oscillatory slowing in AD progression, we analyzed features of high-power oscillatory events and their relationship to cognitive decline. MEG resting-state oscillations were registered in age-matched patients with MCI who later convert (CONV, N=41) or do not convert (NOCONV, N=44) to AD, in a period of 2.5 years. To distinguish future CONV from NOCONV, we characterised the rate, duration, frequency span and power of transient high-power events in the alpha and beta band in anterior cingulate (ACC) and precuneus (PC).  Results revealed event-like patterns in resting-state power in both the alpha and beta-bands, how-ever only beta-band features were predictive of conversion to AD, particularly in PC. Specifically, compared to NOCONV, CONV had a lower number of beta events, along with lower power events and a trend toward shorter duration events in PC (p < 0.05). Beta event durations were also significantly shorter in ACC (p < 0.01). Further, this reduced expression of beta events in CONV predicted lower values of mean relative beta power, increased probability of AD conversion, and poorer cognitive performance.  Our work paves the way for reinterpreting M/EEG slowing and examining beta event features as a new biomarker along the AD continuum, and a potential link to theories of inhibitory cognitive control in neurodegeneration. These results may bring us closer to understanding the neural mechanisms of the disease that help guide new therapies."

MethodA cross-sectional hospital-based study was conducted at Saint Paul Millennium Medical College (SPMCC) between January 2021 and January 2023. All female pregnant patients who were attending the Maternal Care Fetal Unit, Antenatal Unit, and High-Risk Unit at SPMMC were included in this study. However, among those patients, those mothers younger than 20 years old and older than 40 years old were excluded from the study. The total sample size collected from this facility was 250 patients.  ResultsOxidative stress and inflammation were primarily correlated with pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. These risk factors were particularly prevalent within patients diagnosed with PPCM, 52.8% and 40% respectively. Prolactin Cleavage and Microvascular Dysfunction was associated with higher BMI and advanced age. With a general increasing trend observed in PPCM incidence and advancing age. As well as a high prevalence rate of PPCM in patients with Obesity Class I (at 33.0%). Another notable risk factor was high parity ( 45.0% with 4+ prior pregnancies).

This protocol describes a trial that aims to assess the effectiveness of intraoperative ICG metrics of the cut edge of the pancreas to predict postoperative fistulas. A single group will participate in an observational, surgeon-blinded, phase II trial. ICG measurements of the cut edge of the pancreas will be recorded before reconstruction. International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery criteria for pancreatic fistula will be used to define leaks and fistulas. The primary outcome will be the correlation between ICG measurements and the development or absence of fistula formation.

Current standards for the diagnosis of AAE rely on screening for known neuronal autoantibodies in patient serum or cerebrospinal fluid. However, this diagnostic method fails to capture a subset of drug-resistant epilepsy patients with suspected AAE who respond to immunotherapy yet remain seronegative (snAAE) for known autoantibodies.  MethodsTo identify potential biomarkers for snAAE, we evaluated the most comprehensive panel of assayed cytokines and autoantibodies to date, comparing patients with snAAE, anti-seizure medication (ASM) responsive epilepsy, and patients with other neuroinflammatory diseases.  ResultsWe found a unique signature of 14 cytokines significantly elevated in snAAE patients including: GM-CSF, MCP-2/CCL8, MIP-1a/CCL3, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-15, IL-20, VEGF-A, TNF-b, LIF, and TSLP. Based on prior literature, we highlight IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, VEGF-A, and TNF-b as potentially actionable cytokine biomarkers for snAAE, which could be of diagnostic utility in clinical evaluations of snAAE patients. Autoantibody-ome screening failed to identify autoantibodies targeting neuronal channel proteins in snAAE patients. Interestingly, ASM-responsive epilepsy patients displayed elevations in the proportion of autoantibodies targeting brain plasma membrane proteins, possibly pointing to the presence of immune hyperactivity/dysfunction despite well-controlled seizure activity and suggesting ASM-responsive patients may experience disease progression independent of seizure activity (PISA).  DiscussionOverall, our findings suggest that simply expanding existing autoantibody screens may not sufficiently enhance diagnostic power for snAAE. Instead, we propose that cytokine analysis may serve as a promising diagnostic avenue for identifying immune dysregulation in AAE patients and enabling opportunities for trials of immunotherapies."

However, routine clinical evaluation for dystonia in CP has failed to match these expected numbers. Addressing this diagnostic gap is a medical imperative because the presence of dystonia rules in or out certain treatments for motor symptoms in CP. Therefore, our objective was to optimize rates of clinical dystonia screening to improve rates of clinical dystonia diagnosis.  MethodsUsing the quality improvement (QI) infrastructure of the Cerebral Palsy Research Network (CPRN), we developed and implemented interventions to increase the documentation percentage of five features of dystonia in young people with CP, aged 3-21 years old. This QI initiative was implemented by seven physiatry and pediatric movement disorders physicians at four tertiary-care pediatric hospitals between 10/10/21 and 7/1/23. We collected visit data cross-sectionally across all participating sites every 2 weeks and tracked our progress using control charts.  ResultsWe assessed 847 unique visits, mostly for established patients (719/847, 85%) who were 9.2 years old on average (95% CI 8.8-9.5). By 4/10/22, the mean percentage of dystonia screening elements documented across all sites rose from 39% to 90% and the mean percentage of visits explicitly documenting the presence or absence of dystonia rose from 65% to 94%. By 10/23/22, the percentage of visits diagnosing dystonia rose from 57% to 74%. These increases were all sustained through the end of the study period in 7/1/23.  DiscussionUsing a rigorous QI-driven process across four member sites of a North American learning health network (CPRN), we demonstrated that we could increase screening for dystonia and that this was associated with increased clinical dystonia diagnosis, matching expected research-based rates. We propose that similar screening should take place across all sites caring for people with CP."

The raw data from the Casia2 device, in 3dv format, was converted into 16 images per examination of one eye. For the training, validation and testing phases, 3689, 1050 and 1078 scans (3dv files) were selected, respectively.  ResultsIn the prediction of the ESI, the MAE values for the adapted ResNet18, DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB0, rounded to two decimal places, were 7.15, 6.64 and 5.86, respectively. In the classification task, the three networks yielded an accuracy of 94.80%, 95.27% and 95.83%, respectively; a sensitivity of 92.07%, 94.64% and 94.17%, respectively; a specificity of 96.61%, 95.69% and 96.92%, respectively; a PPV of 94.72%, 93.55% and 95.28%, respectively; and a F1 score of 93.38%, 94.09% and 94.72%, respectively.  ConclusionsOur results show that the prediction of keratokonus based on the ESI values estimated from raw data outperforms previous approaches using processed data. Adapted EfficientNetB0 outperformed both the other adapted models and those in state-of-the-art studies, with the highest accuracy and F1 score."

Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a promising tool in mitigating risks of medication-related harm. In particular, large language models (LLMs) and well-developed generative adversarial networks (GANs) showing promise for healthcare related tasks. This review aims to explore the scope and effectiveness of generative AI in reducing medication-related harm, identifying existing development and challenges in research.  MethodsWe searched for peer reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus for literature published from January 2012 to February 2024. We included studies focusing on the development or application of generative AI in mitigating risk for medication-related harm during the entire medication use process. We excluded studies using traditional AI methods only, those unrelated to healthcare settings, or concerning non-prescribed medication uses such as supplements. Extracted variables included study characteristics, AI model specifics and performance, application settings, and any patient outcome evaluated.  FindingsA total of 2203 articles were identified, and 14 met the criteria for inclusion into final review. We found that generative AI and large language models were used in a few key applications: drug-drug interaction identification and prediction; clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance. While the performance and utility of these models varied, they generally showed promise in areas like early identification and classification of adverse drug events and support in decision-making for medication management. However, no studies tested these models prospectively, suggesting a need for further investigation into the integration and real-world application of generative AI tools to improve patient safety and healthcare outcomes effectively.  InterpretationGenerative AI shows promise in mitigating medication-related harms, but there are gaps in research rigor and ethical considerations. Future research should focus on creation of high-quality, task-specific benchmarking datasets for medication safety and real-world implementation outcomes."

Our prior study identified that a patient decision aid, RealRisks, improved patient-reported outcomes relative to standard educational materials. This study examined patients GT experience and its influence on subsequent actions. We also sought to identify areas for improvement in RealRisks that would expand its focus from improved GT decision-making to understanding results.  MethodsWomen enrolled in the parent randomized controlled trial were recruited and interviewed. Demographic data was collected from surveys in the parent study. Interviews were conducted, transcribed, and coded to identify recurring themes. Descriptive statistics were generated to compare the interviewed subgroup to the original study cohort of 187 women.  ResultsOf the 22 women interviewed, 11 (50%) had positive GT results, 2 (9.1%) with a BRCA1/2 PV, and 9 (40.9%) with variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Median age was 40.5 years and 15 (71.4%) identified as non-Hispanic. Twenty (90.9%) reported a family history of BC, and 2 (9.1%) reported a family history of BRCA1/2 PV. The emerging themes included a preference for structured communication of GT results and the need for more actionable knowledge to mitigate BC risk, especially among patients with VUS or negative results. Few patients reported lifestyle changes following the return of their results, although they did understand that their behaviors can impact their BC risk.  ConclusionsPatients preferred a structured explanation of their GT results to facilitate a more personal testing experience. While most did not change lifestyle behaviors in response to their GT results, there was a consistent call for further guidance following the initial discussion of GT results. Empowering patients, especially those with negative or VUS results, with the knowledge and context to internalize the implications of their results and form accurate risk perception represents a powerful opportunity to mediate subsequent risk management strategies. Informed by this study, future work will expand RealRisks to foster an accurate perception of GT results and include decision support to navigate concrete next steps."

Recent studies recognize the potential impact of HLA-DPB1 mismatches on HCT outcomes. Multiple approaches focus on finding better-tolerated HLA-DPB1 mismatches. Additionally, recent studies suggest matching at noncoding HLA sequence may improve HCT outcomes. This study aims to evaluate different approaches for categorizing DPB1 mismatches in patient-donor pairs and explore the potential impact of noncoding mismatches (available in class I HLA genes) on clinical outcomes.  MethodsA retrospective study of 5,106 HCT pairs using Cox proportional hazards models, weighted by a machine learning algorithm, evaluates the impact of particular combinations of HLA-DPB1 mismatches in the context of noncoding HLA class I mismatches on outcomes of HCT. HLA-DPB1 mismatch criteria included T-cell epitope permissive/non-permissive mismatches, expression markers, and evolutionary clade mismatches.  ResultsTwo HLA-DPB1 mismatches, using multiple criteria, lead to significant hazards of acute graft versus host disease grades 2-4, in the T cell replete group. When HLA-DPB1 mismatches occurred across evolutionary clades (DP2 allele/low-expression patient vs DP5 allele/high-expression in the donor), the deplete group showed significant hazards for treatment-related mortality (TRM) (HR=1.94, p-value=8.9x10-7) and overall survival (OS) (HR=1.67, p-value=1.3x10-5) for additive effects of noncoding mismatches with two HLA-DPB1 mismatches.  ConclusionTwo HLA-DPB1 mismatches remain to predict worse outcomes. However, noncoding mismatches in HLA class I genes confer elevated hazards of TRM and OS in conjunction with mismatches across evolutionary branches of HLA-DPB1. Therefore, noncoding mismatches may inform donor selection in the presence of HLA-DPB1 mismatches and improve HCT outcomes, emphasizing the utility of comprehensive sequencing of HLA alleles in HCT settings."

Over the study period, 24,976 individual female sex workers HIV tested, of whom 9.5% (2,363/24,979) newly tested HIV positive. Of these 2,363 women, 55.5% (1311/2,363) were offered and gave consent for a sample to be taken for DBS recency and viral load testing, among whom 11.7% (153/1,311) were classified as having a recent infection. A subset of 464 women were offered and consented to paired sample collection, among whom 10.1% (47) and 12.3% (57) of plasma and DBS samples, respectively, were classified as recent. Overall, categorical determination was good, with 97% of results concordant.

Recent work has highlighted the role of circulating lipoproteins in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). We sought to triangulate human observational and genetic evidence to evaluate the role of Lp(a) in AAA.  MethodsWe tested the association between circulating levels of Lp(a) and clinically diagnosed abdominal aortic aneurysms while controlling for traditional AAA risk factors and levels of ApoB using logistic regression among 795 individuals with and 374,772 individuals without AAA in the UK Biobank (UKB). Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was used to test for putatively causal associations between Lp(a) and AAA controlling for ApoB. Genetic instruments for Lp(a) and ApoB were created from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Lp(a) and ApoB comprising 335,796 and 418,505 UKB participants, respectively. The instruments were tested for association with AAA using data from a GWAS of 39,221 individuals with and 1,086,107 without AAA.  ResultsElevated Lp(a) levels were observationally associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.04 per 10 nmol/L Lp(a); 95%CI 1.02-1.05; P<0.01). Clinically elevated Lp(a) levels (>150nmol/L) were likewise associated with an increased risk of AAA (OR 1.47; 95% CI 1.15-1.88; P < 0.01) when compared to individuals with Lp(a) levels <150nmol/L. MVMR confirmed a significant, ApoB-independent association between increased Lp(a) and increased risk of AAA (OR 1.13 per SD increase in Lp(a); 95%CI 1.02-1.24; P<0.02).  ConclusionBoth observational and genetic analyses support an association between increased Lp(a) and AAA risk that is independent of ApoB. These findings suggest that Lp(a) may be a therapeutic target for AAA and drive the inclusion of AAA as an outcome in clinical trials of Lp(a) antagonists."

The study included 120 children who had been transplanted between 1991 and 2010 and were followed by routine biopsies and histological evaluations with a median of 14.1 years post-LT. Liver biopsies were performed routinely 1, 5, 10 and 20 years after transplantation and in the event of liver dysfunction. HED was calculated using the physicochemical Grantham distance for donor and recipient class I (HLA-A, -B, -C) and class II (HLA-DRB1, -DQB1) alleles. The influence of HED on rejection was analyzed using IPW and target trial emulation using the g method. Based on the IPW score, donor HED class I was correlated with the occurrence of late (>90 days) rejection (HR, 1.19, 95% CI: 1.01-1.40) independently of HLA mismatches, donor age and initial induction. This emulated target trial confirmed that donor HED class I has a causal effect on liver graft rejection and this relationship was observed long-term."

ObjectiveTo test the independent associations of baseline levels and longitudinal changes in epigenetic clocks with mortality  DesignLongitudinal study  SettingInCHIANTI, a population-based study of community dwelling individuals in Tuscany, Italy.  Participants699 InCHIANTI study participants aged 21-95 years at baseline with longitudinal measurements of DNA methylation.  ExposureBaseline levels and longitudinal changes in seven epigenetic clocks, including two first-generation clocks developed using chronological age for reference (Hannum Clock, Horvath Clock), three second-generation clocks developed using time-to-death for references (DNAmPhenoAge, DNAmGrimAge, DNAmGrimAge Version 2), and two third-generation clocks developed using longitudinal rate of change of multiple phenotypes for reference (DunedinPOAm_38, DunedinPACE).  Main Outcomes and MeasuresMortality was the primary outcome. Cox regression was used to estimate independent associations of baseline and longitudinal changes in epigenetic clocks with mortality.  ResultsAdjusting for age, sex, study sites, and epigenetic clock at the baseline, longitudinal changes of the following epigenetic clocks were associated with mortality: Hannum clock (aHR = 1.14, 95% CI:[1.03, 1.26]), DNAmPhenoAge (aHR = 1.23, 95% CI: [1.10,1.37]), DNAmGrimAge (aHR = 1.13, 95% CI: [1.02,1.26]), DNAmGrimAge Version 2 (aHR = 1.18, 95% CI:[1.06,1.31]), and DunedinPOAm_38 (aHR = 1.15, 95%CI: [1.01,1.30]).  Conclusions and RelevanceOur findings confirm that epigenetic clocks capture a dimension of health that is predictive of mortality and add the notion that time changes of epigenetic age reflect changes in health that additionally and independently contribute to mortality prediction. Future studies should test whether interventions that slow down the rate of epigenetic aging are associated with longer healthspan and lifespan.  Key PointsQuestion: Is the rate of change in epigenetic clock associated with differential mortality?  Findings: In 699 adults with followed for up to 24 years, faster longitudinal changes in epigenetic clocks (Hannum clock, DNAmPhenoAge, DNAmGrimAge, DNAmGrimAge version 2, DunedinPOAm_38, DunedinPACE) were significantly associated with higher mortality, independent of baseline epigenetic age and other confounders.  Meaning: Independent of chronological age, epigenetic clock and change over time of epigenetic clock independently predicted the risk of death. Interventions that slow down the pace of epigenetic aging may enhance healthy longevity."

The aim of the current study was to leverage human genetic evidence to inform clinical development of interleukin-6 (IL6) signaling inhibition for treatment of AAA.  MethodsWe focused on rs2228145, a missense variant in the IL6R gene region whose associations are expressed per additional copy of the C allele, corresponding to the genetically-predicted effect of IL6 signaling inhibition. We consider genetic associations with AAA risk in the AAAgen consortium (39,221 cases, 1,086,107 controls) and UK Biobank (2215 cases, 365,428 controls). To validate against known effects of IL6 signaling inhibition, we present associations with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and severe COVID-19. To explore mechanism specificity, we present associations with thoracic aortic aneurysm, intracranial aneurysm, and coronary artery disease. We further evaluated associations with measures of the abdominal aorta in UK Biobank, and explored genetic associations in clinically-relevant subgroups of the population.  ResultsWe observed strong genetic associations with AAA risk in the AAAgen consortium and in UK Biobank: odds ratio (OR) 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.90 to 0.92, p = 4x10-30) and OR 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.96, p=0.0007), respectively. The association with AAA risk in UK Biobank was linear in the number of minor alleles: OR 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.00) in heterozygotes and OR 0.80 (95% CI: 0.71, 0.92) in minor homozygotes. The association was similar for fatal AAA, but with greater uncertainty due to the lower number of events. The association with AAA was of greater magnitude than associations with coronary artery disease and even rheumatologic disorders for which IL6 inhibitors have been approved. No strong associations were observed with thoracic aortic aneurysm, intracranial aneurysm, or abdominal aorta diameter in the general population without AAA. Associations attenuated towards the null in populations with concomitant inflammatory or connective tissue disease.  ConclusionsThis drug target Mendelian randomization study supports that IL6 signaling inhibition will be efficacious for treating AAA, but not other types of aneurysmal disease. These findings serve to help inform clinical development of IL6 signaling inhibition for AAA treatment."

We aimed to examine if a diverse set of biomarkers in the REHAB-HF trial would predict improvement in physical function following a 12-week tailored physical therapy rehabilitation intervention compared to attention control.  MethodsThe study population consisted of participants [&ge;]60 years of age who were hospitalized with acute HF and randomized to a subsequent multidomain outpatient physical rehabilitation intervention vs. attention control with outcomes of 12-week functional change including the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and six-minute walk distance (6MWD). Blood was collected prior to randomization and at 12-weeks for cardiac, renal, and inflammatory biomarkers. Linear trends across progressively higher biomarker values versus improvement in functional outcomes based on treatment assignment were evaluated. Classification and regression trees (CART) were created to estimate optimal biomarker levels associated with differential improvement in the two functional outcomes.  ResultsA total of 242 of 349 participants (69%) had baseline biomarkers measured. In an adjusted regression model, higher baseline cardiac troponin (cTn) I and T were associated with greater gains in SPPB and 6MWD respectively with the rehabilitation intervention (P=0.04 and 0.03 for interaction) versus attention control. In the CART analysis of the physical rehabilitation and attention control participants, those with baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and hs-cTnT [&ge;]36 ng/L receiving the rehabilitation intervention had a 129 m (95% CI 78-180m) greater 12-week 6MWD increase vs attention control. In contrast, for participants with CRP<9.9 mg/L there was no significant incremental 6MWD difference (30m, 95% CI -0.5m, 60.2m). For SPPB, a CRP [&ge;]9.9 mg/L and creatinine [&ge;]1.4 mg/dL optimally identified a differential improvement with the rehabilitation intervention versus attention control. The biomarkers (except for creatinine) decreased by 12 weeks post hospitalization but with no differences based on treatment assignment.  ConclusionHigher baseline levels of biomarkers of inflammation, cardiac injury, and renal dysfunction identified older adults after a HF hospitalization with the greatest differential improvement in physical function with a rehabilitation intervention.

The plasma proteome holds promise as a future diagnostic and prognostic tool that can accurately reflect complex human traits and disease processes. We assessed the ability of plasma proteins to predict ASCVD.  MethodClinical, genetic, and high-throughput plasma proteomic data were analyzed for association with ASCVD in a cohort of 41,650 UK Biobank participants. Selected features for analysis included clinical variables such as a UK-based cardiovascular clinical risk score (QRISK3) and lipid levels, 36 polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and Olink protein expression data of 2,920 proteins. We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to select features and compared area under the curve (AUC) statistics between data types. Randomized LASSO regression with a stability selection algorithm identified a smaller set of more robustly associated proteins. The benefit of plasma proteins over standard clinical variables, the QRISK3 score, and PRSs was evaluated through the derivation of {Delta} AUC values. We also assessed the incremental gain in model performance using proteomic datasets with varying numbers of proteins. To identify potential causal proteins for ASCVD, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.  ResultThe mean age of our cohort was 56.0 years, 60.3% were female, and 9.8% developed incident ASCVD over a median follow-up of 6.9 years. A protein-only LASSO model selected 294 proteins and returned an AUC of 0.723 (95% CI 0.708-0.737). A clinical variable and PRS-only LASSO model selected 4 clinical variables and 20 PRSs and achieved an AUC of 0.726 (95% CI 0.712-0.741). The addition of the full proteomic dataset to clinical variables and PRSs resulted in a {Delta} AUC of 0.010 (95% CI 0.003-0.018). Fifteen proteins selected by a stability selection algorithm offered improvement in ASCVD prediction over the QRISK3 risk score [{Delta} AUC: 0.013 (95% CI 0.005-0.021)]. Filtered and clustered versions of the full proteomic dataset (consisting of 600-1,500 proteins) performed comparably to the full dataset for ASCVD prediction. Using MR, we identified 11 proteins as potentially causal for ASCVD.  ConclusionA plasma proteomic signature performs well for incident ASCVD prediction but only modestly improves prediction over clinical and genetic factors. Further studies are warranted to better elucidate the clinical utility of this signature in predicting the risk of ASCVD over the standard practice of using the QRISK3 score."

We assessed the ability of plasma proteins to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and related traits.  MethodsClinical, genetic, and high-throughput proteomic data from three subcohorts of UK Biobank participants were analyzed for association with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) derived truncal fat (in the adiposity subcohort), estimated maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) (in the fitness subcohort), and incident T2DM (in the T2DM subcohort). We used least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to assess the relative ability of non-proteomic and proteomic variables to associate with each trait by comparing variance explained (R2) and area under the curve (AUC) statistics between data types. Stability selection with randomized LASSO regression identified the most robustly associated proteins for each trait. The benefit of proteomic signatures (PSs) over QDiabetes, a T2DM clinical risk score, was evaluated through the derivation of delta ({Delta}) AUC values. We also assessed the incremental gain in model performance metrics using proteomic datasets with varying numbers of proteins. A series of two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to identify potentially causal proteins for adiposity, fitness, and T2DM.  ResultsAcross all three subcohorts, the mean age was 56.7 years and 54.9% were female. In the T2DM subcohort, 5.8% developed incident T2DM over a median follow-up of 7.6 years. LASSO-derived PSs increased the R2 of truncal fat and VO2max over clinical and genetic factors by 0.074 and 0.057, respectively. We observed a similar improvement in T2DM prediction over the QDiabetes score [{Delta} AUC: 0.016 (95% CI 0.008, 0.024)] when using a robust PS derived strictly from the T2DM outcome versus a model further augmented with non-overlapping proteins associated with adiposity and fitness. A small number of proteins (29 for truncal adiposity, 18 for VO2max, and 26 for T2DM) identified by stability selection algorithms offered most of the improvement in prediction of each outcome. Filtered and clustered versions of the full proteomic dataset supplied by the UK Biobank (ranging between 600-1,500 proteins) performed comparably to the full dataset for T2DM prediction. Using MR, we identified 4 proteins as potentially causal for adiposity, 1 as potentially causal for fitness, and 4 as potentially causal for T2DM.  Conclusions/InterpretationPlasma PSs modestly improve the prediction of incident T2DM over that possible with clinical and genetic factors. Further studies are warranted to better elucidate the clinical utility of these signatures in predicting the risk of T2DM over the standard practice of using the QDiabetes score. Candidate causally associated proteins identified through MR deserve further study as potential novel therapeutic targets for T2DM."

The objective of this study was to improve access and efficiency of ischemic stroke treatment across four Atlantic Canadian Provinces.  MethodsA stepped-wedge cluster trial was conducted over 30 months with 3 clusters covering 34 sites. The trial was conducted across all 4 Atlantic Canadian provinces: Nova Scotia (NS), New Brunswick (NB), Prince Edward Island (PE), and Newfoundland and Labrador (NL). The design was quasi-randomized, with each cluster associated with one or more provinces: cluster 1 - NS; cluster 2 - NB and PE; and cluster 3 - NL. The patient population was all ischemic stroke patients across all 4 provinces. The intervention was a 6-month modified Quality Improvement Collaborative (mQIC), which was modified from the Breakthrough Series Collaborative to be half of the 1-year period and conducted virtually. The intervention consisted of assembling an interdisciplinary improvement team, 2 full-day workshops, webinars, and virtual site visits. Suggested changes included 6 process improvement strategies.  ResultsThe proportion of patients that received treatment did not increase significantly with the intervention [0.4% increase for patients that received thrombolysis and/or EVT (p=0.68)]. Median door-to-needle time was reduced by 9.2 minutes with the intervention (p=0.01). Cluster 3 saw the greatest improvements in both access and efficiency.  ConclusionsA mQIC intervention resulted in improvement of process measures like door-to-needle time. Quality improvement initiatives may need to be longer to see improvements in proportion of patients treated. Tailored interventions for each health system can ensure that each system sees improvement. In-person activities might be critical to ensure fidelity of the intervention."

In the young (2-45 years), SCD is often attributable to a heritable cardiac condition. Death investigators are often responsible for investigating the cause of death and communicating their results and risk of heritable cardiac conditions with family members of SCD victims. Family often struggles to comprehend the information that is communicated to them.  PurposeTo understand the delivery, reach and impact of communication strategies informing family members of SCD victims about their relatives cause of death and their own risk for heritable cardiac conditions.  MethodsWe conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study. We collected quantitative data via a web-based survey and qualitative data via telephone interviews to investigate how death investigators in Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada, communicate with family members of SCD victims. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the survey data and thematic analysis to analyze the qualitative data. We triangulated data at multiple levels.  ResultsBetween October 2022 and July 2023, we surveyed 78 death investigators and interviewed a subset (n=20). Death investigators reported that SCDs due to suspected heritable cardiac conditions were more difficult (40%, n=31) or slightly more difficult (35%, n = 27) to investigate, often requiring a higher frequency of communication with families. Death investigators reported contacting family members via phone (n=75, 96.1%) and used various strategies to achieve their communication goals. Strategies were influenced by family characteristics; involvement of other professionals; characteristics of the investigation, access to resources, and system-level barriers.  ConclusionSCD investigations in the young due to suspected heritable cardiac conditions were more challenging and required a higher frequency of communication. Death investigators used various strategies to achieve their communication goals. Further research should examine how systematic changes can improve communication with family members.

Several large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found genomic associations with AE-ACEI. However, despite African Americans having a 5-fold increased risk of AE-ACEI, there are no published GWAS from Africa. The aim of this study was to conduct a case-control GWAS of AE-ACEI in a South African population and perform a meta-analysis with an African American and European American population.  MethodsThe GWAS included 202 South African adults with a history of AE-ACEI and 513 controls without angioedema following angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) treatment for at least 2 years. A meta-analysis was conducted with GWAS summary statistics from an African American and European American cohort (from Vanderbilt/Marshfield with 174 cases and 489 controls).  ResultsNo SNPs attained genome-wide significance. However, 26 SNPs in the post-imputation standard GWAS of the South African cohort and 37 SNPs in the meta-analysis were associated to AE-ACEI with suggestive threshold(p-value<5.0x10-06). Some of these SNPs were found to be located close to the genes PRKCQ and RIMS1, previously linked with drug-induced angioedema, and also close to the CSMD1 gene linked to ACEI cough, providing replication at the gene level, but with novel lead SNPs.  ConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of African populations to detect novel variants in replication studies. Further increased sampling across the continent and matched functional work are needed to confirm the importance of genetic variation in understanding the biology of AE-ACEI."

However, it also appears after neurological injuries, such as a chorda tympani section, which suppresses taste perception mediated by the facial nerve.  MethodsIn 120 healthy volunteers, the perception of an iron sulfate solution was assessed at different lingual locations--corresponding to the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves--and with either open (n=60) or closed (n=60) noses to evaluate if it is a taste or an aroma.  ResultsNasal occlusion significantly reduced the perception of iron sulfate. It prevented perception in 31.7% of participants, though it did not completely eliminate it in the remaining 68.3%. Additionally, in open-nosed subjects, the intensity of iron sulfate perception was significantly greater when applied to the base of the tongue (glossopharyngeal nerve) than to the tip (facial nerve). These differences did not persist with nasal occlusion.  ConclusionNasal occlusion diminished but did not abolish the perception of iron sulfate. With an open nose, a differential taste perception was significant, but not with a closed nose. Therefore, metallic perception involves both retro-olfactory and gustatory components, suggesting it is a metallic flavor."

This study had three aims: (1) to examine the classification accuracy of several drinking quantity/frequency indicators in a large representative sample of U.S. community adults; (2) to extend the findings to a clinical sample of adults; and (3) to examine potential sex differences.  DesignThis retrospective study utilized receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate area under the curve (AUC). Optimal cut-offs were identified using the Youden Index. Diagnostic validity was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV).  MeasurementsIndex tests included measures of quantity/frequency (e.g., drinks/drinking day, largest drinks/drinking day, number of drinking days, and heavy drinking frequency). The reference standard was AUD status as determined via a clinical interview (community sample) or a symptom checklist (clinical sample).  Setting and ParticipantsTwo samples were examined: A large, nationally representative random sample of U.S. community adults who reported past-year drinking (N=25,778, AUD=20%) and a consecutive drinking clinical sample from a Canadian mental health and addictions inpatient treatment centre (N=1,341, AUD=82%).  FindingsAll drinking indicators performed much better than chance at classifying AUD (AUCs=0.60-0.92, ps<.0001). Heavy drinking frequency indicators performed optimally in both the community (AUCs=0.78-0.87; accuracy=0.72-0.80) and clinical (AUC=0.85-0.92; accuracy =0.77-0.89) samples. Collectively, the most discriminating drinking behaviors were heavy drinking episodes and exceeding NIAAA drinking low-risk guidelines. No substantive sex differences in optimal cut-offs or variable performance were observed.  ConclusionsDrinking patterns performed well at classifying AUD in both a nationally representative and large inpatient sample, robustly identifying AUD at rates much better than chance and above accepted benchmarks, with limited differences by sex. Findings broadly support the potential utility of quantitative drinking indicators as being diagnostically informative in clinical settings."

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are commonly associated with aging and cognitive decline, and higher WMH burden has been linked to the progression from healthy cognitive status (HC) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Understanding how cognitive reserve, as indicated by education, influences the relationship between WMH burden and cognitive outcomes can provide valuable insights for interventions aimed at delaying cognitive decline.  ObjectiveThis study investigates the moderating role of education, as a proxy for cognitive reserve, on the relationship between WMH burden and the transition from HC to MCI.  MethodsData were obtained from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, focusing on participants classified as cognitively healthy at baseline. A total of 153 cognitively healthy adults at the baseline were split into two groups: one group (n=85) remained cognitively healthy for at least 7 years, while the other group (n=68) progressed to MCI within 7 years. A multiple linear regression model was used to examine the interaction between group membership, baseline age, education, and sex in predicting WMH loads. The primary focus was on the interaction between group membership and education to assess the protective effect of cognitive reserve.  ResultsThe regression model explained 18.5% of the variance in WMH load. The analysis revealed statistically significant interaction between group membership and education on WMH loads (Interaction term: {beta} = -0.097, p = 0.047), indicating that higher education levels are associated with a reduced WMH burden among individuals who progressed to MCI. The main effect of education alone was not significant, nor were the interactions involving sex (p > 0.05).  ConclusionThese findings support the hypothesis that education, as a proxy for cognitive reserve, provides a protective effect against the accumulation of WMH burden in older adults. The results suggest that higher cognitive reserve may mitigate the impact of neurodegenerative processes, thereby delaying the transition from HC to MCI. This underscores the importance of educational attainment in the preservation of cognitive health during aging."

While chlorinated drinking water is generally considered safe, the antimicrobial effects of chlorine-based disinfectants may negatively impact the developing infant microbiota, which is particularly vulnerable during this critical period. This study investigates the specific effects of chlorinated water on the gut microbiome in infants.  MethodsThe waTer qUality and Microbiome Study (TUMS) is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Six-month old infants (n=197) received either de-chlorinated drinking water (via benchtop filtration), or regular tap water for twelve months. Stool samples were collected at six-months (baseline) and at eighteen-months of age. Metagenomic sequencing was used for faecal microbiome analysis. Samples of participant tap water was also collected pre- and post-intervention.  ResultsParticipants were balanced for sex, delivery method, and breast-feeding status at time of recruitment between the control (n=98) and treatment (n=99) groups. We collected a total of 170 baseline stool samples (83 in the control group and 87 in the treatment group), and 130 follow-up stool samples (65 in the control group and 65 in the treatment group). Interindividual variation was higher at six-months compared to eighteen months. No significant differences in overall community structure (beta diversity (p=0.35), richness (p=0.98) or Shannon Index (p=0.45)) were found between treatment groups. However, 55 genera were differentially abundant at follow-up (adjusted p-value < 0.01), primarily within the Firmicutes phylum. Analysis of metabolic pathways revealed the chlorinated water group showed significantly higher abundance of antibiotic resistance genes mostly attributable to Escherichia and Klebsiella species.  ConclusionWater chlorination induces predominantly minor changes in infant gut microbiome composition; but appears to increase the abundance of antibiotic-resistant genes. While water chlorination remains a vital public health tool for ensuring safe drinking water, our findings underscore the need for continued research into the potential for increased antibiotic resistance and suggest there may be value in exploring alternative disinfectant strategies."

We examined variables to include in normative models for Mayo Test Drive (a multi-device remote cognitive assessment platform) measures, developed normative data, and validated the norms.  Method1240 Cognitively Unimpaired (CU) adults ages 32-100-years (96% white) from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and Mayo Alzheimers Disease Research Center with Clinical Dementia Rating(R) of 0 were included. We converted raw scores to normalized scaled scores and derived regression-based normative data adjusting for age, age2, sex and education (base model); alternative norms are also provided (age+age2+sex; age+age2). We assessed additional terms using an a priori cut-off of 1% variance improvement above the base model. We examined low test performance rates (<-1 standard deviation) in independent validation samples (n=167 CU, n=64 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n=14 dementia). Rates were significantly different when 95% confidence intervals (CI) did not include the expected 14.7% base rate.  ResultsNo model terms met the a priori cut-off beyond the base model, including device type, response input source (e.g., mouse, etc.) or session interference.

There was a significant mediation effect, whereby greater maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms at age 3 years were significantly associated with greater relative right FAA in children at age 5 years, which, in turn, was significantly associated with greater child internalizing symptoms at age 7 years (ps<.001). There was no moderating effect of FAA on the association between maternal internalizing symptoms at age 5 years and child internalizing symptoms at age 7 years.  ConclusionsGreater right frontal asymmetry may be a neurophysiological mechanism that mediates the intergenerational transmission of internalizing symptoms."

ObjectivesTo provide up-to-date estimates of the prevalence and real-world effectiveness of different smoking cessation aids and explore moderation of effectiveness by socioeconomic position.  DesignPopulation-based survey, 2006-2024.  SettingEngland.  Participants25,094 adults ([&ge;]16y) who reported having tried to quit smoking in the past year.  Main outcomes and measuresThe outcome variable was self-reported continuous abstinence from the start of the most recent quit attempt up to the time of survey. Independent variables were use (yes/no) of the following aids in the most recent attempt: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) obtained on prescription or over-the-counter; varenicline; bupropion; e-cigarettes; face-to-face behavioural support; telephone support; written self-help materials; websites; smartphone apps; hypnotherapy; Allen Carrs Easyway method; heated tobacco products (HTPs); nicotine pouches. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics and features of the quit attempt.  ResultsWe analysed data from 25,094 participants (mean [SD] age = 38.7y [15.3]; 48.5% women). In 2023/24, the most used aids were e-cigarettes (40.2%) and over-the-counter NRT (17.3%); 40.8% of quit attempts were unaided. While e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of abstinence after adjustment for use of other aids and covariates (OR=1.95 [1.74-2.17]), use of over-the-counter NRT was not (OR=1.03 [0.93-1.15]). Other aids positively associated with abstinence were websites (used by 4.6% in 2023/24; OR=1.43 [1.03-1.98]), prescription NRT (4.5%; OR=1.33 [1.12-1.58]), varenicline (1.1%; OR=1.80 [1.50-2.18]), and HTPs (0.7%; OR=2.37 [1.24-4.51]). Face-to-face behavioural support (used by 2.2% in 2023/24) was also associated with higher odds of abstinence among those from less advantaged (OR=1.59 [1.19-2.14]) but not more advantaged social grades (OR=0.91 [0.65-1.29]). There was not clear evidence of a benefit of any other aid, although some analyses were inconclusive.  Conclusions and relevanceA range of effective smoking cessation aids are available in England, but many people try to quit using less effective forms of support or none at all. Quit success rates could be improved by encouraging people to use more effective methods."

Our study aims to evaluate the incidence of BPH in Testicular Cancer (TCa) survivors, focusing on the impact of chemotherapy and post TCa diagnosed hypogonadism. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of US veterans diagnosed with TCa between 1990 to 2021, using the Veterans affairs database. BPH was defined using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, or a 6-month prescription of medications. Associations with BPH were analysed, stratifying the cohort by receipt of chemotherapy and presence of hypogonadism. Multivariable cox regression models were used to determine statistical significance (p-value <0.05). Our cohort included 2038 TCa survivors with a median age at diagnosis of 41 years. On multivariable cox regression analysis, receipt of chemotherapy wasnt significantly associated with incidence of BPH (p-value= 0.13). When stratified by diagnosis of hypogonadism prior to BPH, no significant associations were found on univariable (p=0.81) as well as multivariable (p=0.65) analyses. In the multivariable model, age at diagnosis was significantly associated with an increased incidence of BPH (Hazard ratio: 1.06, p<0.001). Our findings demonstrate that age is a significant factor associated with development of BPH in this population, while suggesting that chemotherapy for TCa and hypogonadism might not substantially alter the development of BPH.  Patient summaryIn this study, we looked at whether testicular cancer survivors are more likely to develop an enlarged prostate (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia), especially if they received chemotherapy or had low testosterone afterward. We found that age, rather than cancer treatment or testosterone levels, was the main factor linked to developing an enlarged prostate."

While most omCSPC patients have a more modest delay in progression, a small subset achieves a durable response following SABR. We investigated the prognostic and predictive value of circulating PSMA-positive extracellular vesicles (PSMA+EV) and prostate specific antigen (PSA) in a biomarker correlative study using blood samples from three independent patient cohorts.  MethodsPlasma samples from 46 patients on the ORIOLE trial and 127 patietns on the STOMP trial protocol with omCSPC patients treated with SABR. Pre-SABR PSMA+EV levels (EVs/ml) were measured by nanoscale flow cytometry. Kaplan-Meier curves and logistic regression models were used to determine the association of PSMA+EV and PSA levels with clinical outcomes.  ResultsIn the pooled cohorts, median bPFS were 26.1 and 15.0 months (p=0.005) and median rPFS were 36.0 and 25.0 months (p=0.003) for PSMA+EV low and high groups, respectively. The combination of pre-SABR low levels of both PSMA+EV and PSA was associated with lower risk of radiographic progression (HR=0.34, 95% CI: 0.18-0.58, p=0.0002). In the ORIOLE cohort, which included both a SABR arm and an observation arm, low PSMA+EV was predictive of benefit from SABR (p=0.012).  ConclusionsPSMA+EV is a novel prognostic and predictive biomarker of radiographically occult tumor burden in omCSPC.

We assessed preferences for CCP components among PWH enrolled in the program (""clients"") and among providers of CCP services. In this report we compare the preferences between clients and providers, previously analyzed separately.  MethodsWe used a discrete choice experiment to assess preferences for four CCP features (""attributes""): Help with Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy (ART), Help with Primary Care Appointments, Help with Issues other than Primary Care, and Where Program Visits Happen. Each of these attributes had three to four variants (""levels""). In the original surveys, levels within Where Program Visits Happen varied by participant type (client versus provider). We re-coded the levels by visit location (VL) or by travel time (TT) to make them comparable, and report results from both approaches. Preferences were quantified using the relative importance of the attributes and utility of the levels.  ResultsJanuary 2020 to March 2021, 152 providers and 181 clients completed the survey. In both the VL and TT analyses, clients were most influenced by Help with Adherence to ART, preferring medication reminders via phone or text, and Where Program Visits Happen, preferring visits via phone or video chat. In the VL analysis, providers were most influenced by Help with Adherence to ART, valuing directly observed therapy most highly, and Help with Issues other than Primary Care, valuing helping clients with connections to specialty medical care. In the TT analysis, providers were most influenced by Where Program Visits Happen, preferring to meet at clients homes, and Help with Issues other than Primary Care, again preferring helping clients make connections to specialty medical care.  ConclusionsClient and provider preferences clearly diverged with regard to CCP service intensity: in the aggregate, clients tended to prefer lower-intensity services, whereas providers endorsed higher-intensity services. These results highlight the importance of engaging clients as partners in decisions about program services so that they are aligned with client values."

In the MVP cohort, we adjusted for MACE risk factors as potential confounding variables and saw no significant association between nicotinamide exposure and MACE (HR 1.00 95% CI 0.75 - 1.32), while history of prior MACE remained strongly associated with subsequent MACE (HR 9.50, 95% CI 6.38 - 14.1).  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEIn this retrospective cohort study of 6039 adults from two different patient populations, we found no increased risk of MACE in patients with nicotinamide exposure."

Here we draw on drug checking results from around the United States to report a rapid shift in the illicit drug supply with important implications for public health. Bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piperidyl) sebacate, or ""BTMPS"" is a hindered amine light stabilizer with various industrial applications. Animal studies indicate multiple kinds of adverse health effects.  MethodsDrug samples collected by community-based drug checking programs in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, along with drug residue samples from other jurisdictions in California, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, were submitted to the National Institute on Standards and Technology. Samples were qualitatively tested with Direct Analysis in Real Time mass spectrometry, with reflex to liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS) for confirmatory testing. Quantitation - percent by mass - was performed using LCMS. At both sites where drug samples were collected, participants were asked to respond to a survey that included questions about what the substance was sold as and any unexpected effects.  ResultsBetween June 1, 2024 and August 31, 2024, a total of 178 samples sold as fentanyl were tested. Of these, 43 (24%) contained BTMPS, with the proportion per month rising from 0% in June to more than a third in August. An additional 23 residue samples from sites doing residue testing contained BTMPS. Fentanyl samples with BTMPS also contained many other compounds, including local anesthetics and alpha-2 agonists. Average fentanyl purity was significantly lower in samples with BTMPS compared to samples without.  ConclusionsThe introduction of an industrial chemical to the illicit drug supply at this speed and scale is unprecedented and concerning. Further research is urgently needed to determine why it is present in the fentanyl supply and characterize effects on human health."

Dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may modulate breast adipose fatty acid profiles and downstream bioactive metabolites to counteract pro-inflammatory, pro-carcinogenic signaling in the mammary microenvironment.  ObjectiveTo determine effects of [~]1 to 5 g/d EPA+DHA over 12 months on breast adipose fatty acid and oxylipin profiles in women with ERPR(-) breast cancer, a high-risk molecular subtype.  MethodsWe conducted a 12-month randomized controlled, double-blind clinical trial of [~]5g/d vs [~]1g/d DHA+EPA supplementation in women within 5 years of completing standard therapy for ERPR(-) breast cancer Stages 0-III. Blood and breast adipose tissue specimens were collected every 3 months for biomarker analyses including fatty acids by gas chromatography, oxylipins by LC-MS/MS, and DNA methylation by reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS).  ResultsA total of 51 participants completed the 12-month intervention. Study treatments were generally well-tolerated. While both doses increased n-3 PUFAs from baseline in breast adipose, erythrocytes, and plasma, the 5g/d supplement was more potent (n =51, p <0.001). The 5g/d dose also reduced plasma triglycerides from baseline (p =0.008). Breast adipose oxylipins at 0, 6, and 12 months showed dose-dependent increases in unesterified and esterified DHA and EPA metabolites (n =28). Distinct DNA methylation patterns in adipose tissue after 12 months were identified, with effects unique to the 5g/d dose group (n =17).  ConclusionsOver the course of 1 year, EPA+DHA dose-dependently increased concentrations of these fatty acids and their derivative oxylipin metabolites, producing differential DNA methylation profiles of gene promoters involved in metabolism-related pathways critical to ERPR(-) breast cancer development and progression. These data provide evidence of both metabolic and epigenetic effects of n-3 PUFAs in breast adipose tissue, elucidating novel mechanisms of action for high-dose EPA+DHA-mediated prevention of ERPR(-) breast cancer.

However, false positive results such as UGI imaging will bring unnecessary mental pain, expensive examination costs, examination injuries and other adverse consequences. However, false negative results such as UGI imaging lead to delayed treatment, and patients will have to bear the adverse consequences of poor prognosis, high treatment costs, poor quality of life, and short survival time. It is urgent to find a convenient, economical and non-invasive diagnostic method to reduce the false negative rate and false positive rate of UGI imaging. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of YiDiXie-SS and YiDiXie-HS in esophageal cancer.

Ultrasound is widely used in the diagnosis of ovarian tumors. However, false-positive ultrasound results can lead to false diagnosis, and patients will have to bear unnecessary mental pain, expensive surgery and examination costs, surgical trauma, organ removal, loss of function, and even serious complications in the perioperative period, and other adverse consequences. False-negative ultrasound results lead to delayed treatment, and patients will have to bear the consequences of poor prognosis, high treatment costs, poor quality of life, and poor survival. There is an urgent need to find convenient, cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic methods to reduce the false-negative and false-positive rates of ovarian ultrasound. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of YiDiXie-SS, YiDiXie-HS and YiDiXie-D in Ovarian cancer.  Patients and methodsThe study finally included 79 study subjects (malignant group, n=12; benign group, n=67). Remaining serum samples from the subjects were collected and tested by applying YiDiXie all-cancer detection kit to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of YiDiXie-SS, YiDiXie-HS and YiDiXie-D, respectively.  ResultsYiDiXie-SS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 75.8% - 100%) and a specificity of 61.2% (95% CI: 49.2% - 72.0%). YiDiXie -HS had a sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI: 64.6% - 99.6%) and a specificity of 86.6% (95% CI: 76.4% - 92.8%). The sensitivity of YiDiXie  -D was 33.3% (95% CI: 13.8% - 60.0%) and its specificity was 97.0% (95% CI: 89.8% - 99.5%). The sensitivity of YiDiXie-SS in ultrasound-positive patients was 100% (95% CI: 67.6% - 100%) and its specificity was 61.9% (95% CI: 40.9% - 79.2%). This represents a 61.9% (95% CI: 40.9% - 79.2%) reduction in the rate of false-positive ovarian ultrasound with the application of YiDiXie-SS with essentially no increase in malignant tumor under-diagnosis. The sensitivity of YiDiXie-HS in ultrasound-negative patients was 75.0% (95% CI: 30.1% - 98.7%) and its specificity was 84.8% (95% CI: 71.8% - 92.4%). This means that the application of YiDiXie-HS reduces the false negative rate of ultrasound by 75.0% (95% CI: 30.1% - 98.7%). YiDiXie -D had a sensitivity of 25.0% (95% CI: 4.4% - 59.1%) in ultrasound-positive patients and its specificity was 95.2% (95% CI: 77.3% - 99.8%). This represents a 95.2% (95% CI: 77.3% - 99.8%) reduction in the rate of ultrasound false positives with YiDiXie-SS.  ConclusionYiDiXie-SS markedly reduced the false-positive rate of ovarian ultrasound with essentially no increase in delayed treatment of malignant tumors. YiDiXie-HS substantially reduced the false-negative rate of ovarian ultrasound. YiDiXie -D substantially reduced the false-positive rate of ovarian ultrasound.

Despite extensive research, the pathophysiology of FM remains poorly understood, complicating diagnosis and treatment, which often relies on self-report questionnaires. This study explored structural and functional brain changes in women with FM, identified potential biomarkers, and examined their relationship with FM severity. MRI data from 33 female FM patients and 33 matched healthy controls were utilized, focusing on T1-weighted MRI and resting-state fMRI scans. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed using a machine learning framework to differentiate FM patients from healthy controls and predict FM symptom severity. No significant differences were found in brain structural features, such as gray matter volume, white matter volume, deformation-based morphometry, and cortical thickness. However, significant differences in FC were observed between FM patients and healthy controls, particularly in the default mode network (DMN), somatomotor network (SMN), visual network (VIS), and dorsal attention network (DAN). The FC metrics were significantly associated with FM severity. Our prediction model differentiated FM patients from healthy controls with an area under the curve of 0.65. FC measures accurately estimated FM symptom severities with a significant correlation (r = 0.45, p = 0.007). Functional connections in the DMN, VIS, and DAN were crucial in determining FM severity. These findings suggest that integrating brain FC measurements could serve as valuable biomarkers for early detection of FM and predicting FM symptom severity, improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies."

ResultsParticipants indicated that non-attendance had predominantly negative implications for the health service, healthcare provider, and patient. The interconnected issue of non-attendance encompassed multiple areas and were broadly categorised into five inductively identified themes: impact of non-attendance, perceptions of value, material deprivation, service delivery and built environment, and professional role and identity. Non-attendance mitigation strategies generated by participants were deductively mapped to the theoretical domains framework (TDF) to explore behavioural determinants that may influence successful implementation. This included knowledge, reinforcement, goals, optimism, memory, attention and decision-making, environmental resources and context, and emotions.  ConclusionsStaff identified multiple strategies for reducing non-attendance; implementing many of these strategies would require additional resourcing. Research determining the effectiveness of such strategies both in the short-term and long-term following implementation into practice remains a priority for future investigation."

This has important implications for early cognitive deficits as these nuclei are sources of ascending neuromodulators (i.e., dopamine and noradrenaline) that support various cognitive functions like learning, memory, and executive function. However, because most studies of the relationship between patterns of degeneration and cognition have either studied these neuromodulator systems in isolation or studied specific cognitive domains in isolation, it is unknown if degeneration in the substantia nigra and degeneration in the locus coeruleus independently and selectively contribute to different cognitive deficits in Parkinsons disease.  To address this gap, we tested people with Parkinsons disease and older adults on tasks of positive reinforcement learning, attention/working memory, executive function, and memory to measure performance in domains of cognition specifically thought to be related to dopaminergic and noradrenergic function. Participants also underwent neuromelanin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging which provides a measure of degeneration of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra and of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus. Brain-behaviour relationships were evaluated by separate linear regressions predicting cognitive performance in each domain from substantia nigra and locus coeruleus neuromelanin signal intensities controlling for age, sex, and education.  As expected, Parkinsons disease patients had significantly slower learning from positive feedback and lower performance on tests of attention/working memory, executive function, and memory than controls. Parkinsons patients also had lower neuromelanin signal intensity in the substantia nigra and locus coeruleus. Examining brain-behaviour relationships, we found that reduced neuromelanin signal in the substantia nigra in Parkinsons disease patients was independently associated with impaired positive reinforcement learning, controlling for changes in the locus coeruleus, but was not associated with other domains of cognition. In contrast, reduced neuromelanin signal in the locus coeruleus was independently associated with impairments in attention/working memory and executive function, controlling for changes in the substantia nigra, but not with reinforcement learning performance. These results show that substantia nigra degeneration and locus coeruleus degeneration independently and selectively contribute to cognitive deficits and therefore suggests that individual differences in the degree of neurodegeneration in these nuclei could explain the significant heterogeneity that exists in the cognitive and behavioural manifestations of Parkinsons disease. These findings also highlight the potential value of leveraging known brain-behaviour relationships to develop performance-based measures of cognition that reflect underlying patterns of neurodegeneration."

We also found that cervical cancers caused by HPV types outside of phylogenetic clade 9 had a higher recurrence frequency than those caused by 9 types in both our study and The Cancer Genome Atlas cervical cancer database, despite the higher prevalence of 9 types including HPV16 in cervical cancer.

Current evaluations have primarily focused on the financial and temporal aspects of litigation, leaving a gap in understanding the experiences of plaintiffs within the adversarial system. This study aims to fill this gap by critically exploring the experiences of those affected by medical negligence and the ensuing legal process.  MethodsA qualitative descriptive approach was employed to explore the experiences of plaintiffs following patient safety incidents and their interactions with the legal process. Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with participants who had been involved in medical negligence litigation in Ireland. Participants were eligible for inclusion if they were aged 18 years or over and were involved in medical negligence litigation in Ireland (as a plaintiff), whether the case was resolved by negotiated settlement, a form of alternative dispute resolution (e.g. mediation), or trial hearing. Maximum variation sampling was used to capture a diverse range of experiences, with sample size determined by the concept of  information power. Recruitment was facilitated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) through invitations sent by The National Open Disclosure Office. Interviews were conducted in-person or online, recorded, transcribed, and analysed thematically. Ethical approval was obtained from the Social Research Ethics Committee of University College Cork.  FindingsThis research presents the views and experiences of fifteen participants; eleven participants shared their experiences relating to an adverse event which impacted a family member (one participant spoke about two family members), nine of whom were children (including both minors and adult children), and three were a spouse. Of the twelve individuals discussed, eight were deceased. Five main themes were identified from the analysis: i) Navigating the aftermath of a patient safety event: Communication, Support and Abandonment; ii) The pathway from adverse event to litigation; iii) Experiences of the Legal System; iv) Emotional and Mental Health Impact of Litigation on Plaintiffs; v) Advocating for Change: Participant Recommendations.  DiscussionThis research highlights the profound impact of actions taken after a patient safety event on patients, families, healthcare professionals, and organisations, and the importance of Open Disclosure in meeting ethical obligations and ensuring healthcare accountability. It explores the complex relationships between financial compensation, justice-seeking, and the healthcare and legal systems. The findings contribute significant insights to the discourse on medical negligence in Ireland."

Preliminary studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) have demonstrated promising results, but there is room for optimization of the stimulation site, stimulation pattern, and identification of relevant biomarkers of TMS effects. The current pilot study aimed to test the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of a double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over, acute design using intermittent theta burst stimulation to dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) on electroencephalogram (EEG) as intermediate outcome assessment in CUD patients. This small pilot enrolled five individuals with moderate-to-severe CUD for feasibility and proof-of-concept. Participants completed safety, psychometric, and EEG measures before and after receiving two sessions of active or sham TMS to dmPFC on two separate days. All five participants completed all the study tasks and found the TMS to be tolerable. The side effects were minimal and consistent with an acute TMS design. Visible changes were observed in the electrical activity of the brain during a monetary guessing task, while minimal changes in psychometric measures were observed. These results indicate the feasibility and safety of the current approach and suggest that dmPFC is a viable target for treating CUD. Future work should expand upon these findings in a randomized controlled clinical trial."

Objectives1) To comprehensively examine gut microbiome and metabolome changes after laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) in adolescents and 2) to assess whether the microbiome/metabolome changes observed with VSG influence phenotype using germ-free murine models.  Design1) A longitudinal observational study in adolescents undergoing VSG with serial stool samples undergoing shotgun metagenomic microbiome sequencing and metabolomics (polar metabolites, bile acids and short chain fatty acids) and 2) a human-to-mouse fecal transplant study.  ResultsWe show adolescents exhibit significant gut microbiome and metabolome shifts several months after VSG, with increased alpha diversity and notably with enrichment of oral-associated taxa. To assess causality of the microbiome/metabolome changes in phenotype, pre-VSG and post-VSG stool was transplanted into germ-free mice. Post-VSG stool was not associated with any beneficial outcomes such as adiposity reduction compared pre-VSG stool. However, post-VSG stool exhibited an inflammatory phenotype with increased intestinal Th17 and decreased regulatory T cells. Concomitantly, we found elevated fecal calprotectin and an enrichment of proinflammatory pathways in a subset of adolescents post-VSG.  ConclusionWe show that in some adolescents, microbiome changes post-VSG may have inflammatory potential, which may be of importance considering the increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease post-VSG.  What is already known on this topicBariatric surgery is highly effective in achieving weight loss in children and adolescents with severe obesity, however the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, and gut microbiome changes are unknown.  What this study addsSignificant gut microbiome and metabolome shifts were found several months after vertical sleeve gastrectomy in adolescents, notably with enrichment of oral-associated taxa. Using human to germ-free mice fecal transplant studies, the post-surgery changes in the gut microbiome/metabolome were shown to have inflammatory potential. Furthermore, raised fecal calprotectin and inflammatory systemic pathways were seen in a subset of adolescents post-surgery.  How this study might affect research, practice or policyThese findings may be of importance given the growing recognition of an increased incidence of inflammatory bowel disease after bariatric surgery and warrants further investigation."

The coding of transcripts is a critical step for information extraction and preliminary analysis. However, manual coding is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), supported by Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities to understand human languages, which may significantly facilitate the coding process. This study aims to build a computational coding framework that uses GenAI to automatically detect and extract themes from in-depth interview transcripts.  MethodsWe conducted an experiment using transcripts of in-depth interviews with maternity care providers in South Carolina. We leveraged ChatGPT to perform two tasks automatically: (1) deductive coding, which involves applying a predefined set of codes to dialogues; and (2) inductive coding, which can generate codes from dialogues without any preconceptions or assumptions. We fine-tuned ChatGPT to understand the content of the interview transcripts, enabling it to detect and summarize codes. We then evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by comparing the codes generated by ChatGPT with those generated manually by human coders, involving human-in-the-loop evaluation.  ResultsThe results demonstrated the potential of GenAI in detecting and summarizing codes from in-depth interview transcripts. ChatGPT could be utilized for both deductive and inductive coding processes. The overall accuracy of GenAI is higher than 80% and the codes it generated showed high positive associations with those generated manually. More impressively, GenAI reduced the time required for coding by 81%, demonstrating its efficiency compared to traditional methods.  DiscussionGenAI models like ChatGPT show high generalizability, scalability and efficiency in handling large datasets, and are proficient in multi-level semantic structure identification. They demonstrate promising results in qualitative coding, making it a valuable tool for supporting people in public health research. However, challenges such as inaccuracy, systematic biases, and privacy concerns must be addressed when using them in practice. GenAI-based coding results should be handled with caution and reviewed by human coders to ensure accuracy and reliability."

Lesions damaging these neural pathways result in weakness of key muscles causing dysarthria and dysphagia, leading to profound social isolation and risk of aspiration and suffocation. Here we show that Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the motor thalamus improved speech and swallowing functions in two participants with dysarthria and dysphagia. First, we proved that DBS increased excitation of the face motor cortex, augmenting motor evoked potentials, and range and speed of motion of orofacial articulators in n=10 volunteers with intact neural pathways. Then, we demonstrated that this potentiation led to immediate improvement in swallowing functions in a patient with moderate dysphagia and profound dysarthria as a consequence of a traumatic brain lesion. In this subject and in another with mild dysarthria, we showed that DBS immediately ameliorated impairments of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory, and articulatory control thus resulting in a clinically significant improvement in speech intelligibility. Our data provide first-in-human evidence that DBS can be used to treat dysphagia and dysarthria in people with cerebral lesions."

DesignThis interventional trial utilized a Search Prognosis-based biologic assignment algorithm to guide donor selection. Trial enrollment from June 13, 2019-May 13, 2022; analysis of data as of September 7, 2023 with median follow-up post-evaluability of 14.5 months.  SettingsNational multi-center Blood and Marrow Transplantation Clinical Trials Network 1702 study of US participating transplant centers.  ParticipantsAcute myeloid and lymphoid leukemias, myelodysplastic syndrome, Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins lymphomas, severe aplastic anemia, and sickle cell disease patients referred to participating transplant centers were invited to participate. 2225 patients were enrolled and 1751 were declared evaluable for this study. Patients were declared evaluable once it was determined no suitable HLA-matched related donor was available.  InterventionPatients assigned to the Very Likely arm were to proceed with matched unrelated donor, while Very Unlikely were to utilize alternative donors. A third stratum, Less Likely ([~]25%) to find a matched unrelated donor, were observed under standard center practices, but were not part of the primary objective.  Main OutcomeCumulative incidence of transplantation by Search Prognosis arm  ResultsEvaluable patients included 1751 of which 413 (24%) were from racial/ethnic minorities. Search prognosis was 958 (55%) Very Likely, 517 (30%) Less Likely and 276 (16%) Very Unlikely. 1171 (67%) received HCT, 384 (22%) died without HCT, and 196 (11%) remained alive without HCT. Among the 1,234 patients, the adjusted cumulative incidence (95% CI) of HCT at 6-months was 59.8% (56.7-62.8) in the Very Likely group versus 52.3% (46.1-58.5) in the Very Unlikely (P=0.113).  ConclusionsA prospective Search Prognosis-based algorithm can be effectively implemented in a national multicenter clinical trial. This approach resulted in rapid alternative donor identification and comparable rates of HCT in patients Very Likely and Very Unlikely to find a matched unrelated donor.

Given the descriptive nature of seizure semiology and recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), there is a potential to improve the localization accuracy of EZ by leveraging LLMs for interpreting the seizure semiology and mapping its descriptions to the corresponding EZs. This study introduces the Epilepsy Semiology Large Language Model, or EpiSemoLLM, the first fine-tuned LLM designed specifically for this purpose, built upon the Mistral-7B foundational model.  MethodA total of 865 cases, each containing seizure semiology descriptions paired with validated EZs via intracranial EEG recording and postoperative surgery outcome, were collected from 189 publications. These collected data cohort of seizure semiology descriptions and EZs, as the high-quality domain specific data, is used to fine-tune the foundational LLM to improve its ability to predict the most likely EZs. To evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned EpiSemoLLM, 100 well-defined cases were tested by comparing the responses from EpiSemoLLM with those from a panel of 5 epileptologists. The responses were graded using the rectified reliability score (rRS) and regional accuracy rate (RAR). Additionally, the performance of EpiSemoLLM was compared with its foundational model, Mistral-7B, and various versions of ChatGPT, Llama as other representative LLMs.  ResultIn the comparison with a panel of epileptologists, EpiSemoLLM achieved the following score for regional accuracy rates (RAR) with zero-shot prompts: 60.71% for the frontal lobe, 83.33% for the temporal lobe, 63.16% for the occipital lobe, 45.83% for the parietal lobe, 33.33% for the insular cortex, and 28.57% for the cingulate cortex; and mean rectified reliability score (rRS) 0.291. In comparison, the epileptologists averaged RAR scores were 64.83% for the frontal lobe, 52.22% for the temporal lobe, 60.00% for the occipital lobe, 42.50% for the parietal lobe, 46.00% for the insular cortex, and 8.57% for the cingulate cortex; and rectified reliability score (rRS) with mean of 0.148. Notably, the fine-tuned EpiSemoLLM outperformed its foundational LLM, Mistral-7B-instruct, and various versions of ChatGPT and Llama, particularly in localizing EZs in the insular and cingulate cortex. EpiSemoLLM offers valuable information for presurgical evaluations by identifying the most likely EZ location based on seizure semiology.  ConclusionEpiSemoLLM demonstrates comparable performance to epileptologists in inferring EZs from patients seizure semiology, highlighting its value in epilepsy presurgical assessment. EpiSemoLLM outperformed epileptologists in interpreting seizure semiology with EZs originating from the temporal and parietal lobes, as well as the insular cortex. Conversely, epileptologists outperformed EpiSemoLLM regarding EZ localizations in the frontal and occipital lobes and the cingulate cortex.

Yet research on the impact of poor air on adverse birth outcomes (ABOs) especially in the public health aspect is less in India. This study investigates the influence of air quality on birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). Utilizing data from the National Family Health Survey and satellite images, the study employs various statistical analyses and spatial models to elucidate the connection between in-utero exposure to air pollution and birth outcomes, both at the individual and district levels. It was observed that approximately 13% of children were born prematurely, and 17% were born with low birth weight. Increased ambient PM2.5 concentrations during pregnancy were associated with higher odds of LBW (AOR: 1.4; 95% CI: 1.29-1.45). Mothers exposed to PM2.5 during pregnancy had a heightened likelihood of delivering prematurely (AOR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.57-1.77) in comparison to unexposed mothers. Climatic factors such as rainfall and temperature had a greater association with ABOs. Children residing in the Northern districts of India appeared to be more susceptible to the adverse effects of ambient air pollution. Furthermore, indoor air pollution was found to be associated with LBW. Employing a distributed spline approach, the study identified a discernible upward trend in the risk of adverse birth outcomes as the level of exposure increased, particularly following an exposure level of 40 PM2.5 ug/m3. Among the spatial models employed, the MGWR spatial model exhibited the highest level of goodness of fit. In addition to addressing immediate determinants such as nutrition and maternal healthcare, it is imperative to collaboratively address distal factors encompassing both indoor and outdoor pollution to attain lasting enhancements in child health.

Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed 5 distinct and novel TME subtypes across patients (immune-enriched, highly immune and B-cell enriched, fibrotic, immune-desert, and immune-enriched luminal). These TME subtypes were highly correlated with patient prognosis. In order to understand specific factors associated with prognosis, we used unsupervised clustering of a HPV-positive HNSCC cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 53) based on HPV transcript expression, and identified 4 HPV-related subtypes (E2/E5, E6/E7, E1/E4 and L1/L2). Utilizing both viral transcript and TME subtypes, we found that the E2/E5 HPV subtype was associated with an immune-enriched TME and had a higher overall survival compared to other subtypes. The E2/E5 subtype was also enriched for samples without HPV-genome integration, suggesting that episomal HPV status and E2/E5 expression pattern may be associated with an inflamed microenvironment and improved prognosis. In contrast, E6/E7 subtype samples were associated with the fibrotic and immune-desert TME subtypes, with lower values of T-cell and B-cell gene expression signatures and lower overall survival. Both E1/E4 and L1/L2 subtypes were associated with the immune-enriched luminal subtype.

Research on auditory cognitive abilities in real-world older adults is lacking.  In this study, we assess the reproducibility of a range of auditory cognitive abilities in older adults, with a range of hearing abilities, who took part in in-person and online experiments. Participants performed a questionnaire-based assessment and were asked to complete two verbal speech-in-noise perception tasks, for digits and sentences, and two auditory memory tasks, for different sound features. In the first part of the study, 58 Participants performed these tests in-person and online in order to test the reproducibility of the tasks. In the second part, 147 participants conducted all the tasks online in order to test if previously published findings from in-person research were reproducible.  We found that older adults under the age of 70 and those with a better hearing were more likely to take part in online testing. The questionnaire-based test had significantly better reproducibility than the behavioural auditory tests but there were no differences in reproducibility between in-person and online auditory cognitive metrics. Relationships between relationships with age and hearing thresholds in an in-person or online setting were not significantly different.  Furthermore, important relationships between auditory metrics, evidenced in literature previously, were reproducible online.  This study suggests that auditory cognitive testing may be reliably conducted online."

Patients who develop AKI after cardiac surgery are at higher risk of persistent renal dysfunction and increased long-term mortality. The risk of CS-AKI is significantly increased in patients with chronic kidney disease and in patients having prolonged bypass for complex surgery. Previous trials of albumin did not show any benefit in prevention of CS-AKI. These trials, however, did not focus on high-risk patients and used albumin as a resuscitation strategy. The aim of ALBICS-AKI is to demonstrate the effect of concentrated albumin infusion on CS-AKI in high-risk patients undergoing cardiac surgery compared with standard care.  MethodsALBICS-AKI is an investigator initiated, multicentre, randomised, open label trial. Seven centres in Australia and Italy will participate in the trial. We will randomise 620 adult patients who will undergo on-pump cardiac surgery with one of the following: an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73m2, combined valve/s, coronary artery, or surgery involving thoracic aorta. Within 6 hours after surgery, a 20% albumin infusion will commence at 20ml/h for 15 hours. All patients will receive standard care as per institutional protocols. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with AKI according to creatinine based KDIGO definition at hospital discharge or day 28, whichever comes first. Secondary outcomes include Major Adverse Kidney Events at day 28, AKI stage II and III, need for renal replacement therapy, and hospital mortality.

Based on LE8 scores, Cardiovascular Health (CVH) was stratified into three levels--low, moderate, and high--while AIP was categorized into four risk levels: extremely low (AIP<-0.3), low (-0.3[&le;]AIP<0.1), medium (0.1[&le;]AIP<0.24), and high (AIP[&ge;]0.24). Weighted ordinal logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine the association between CVH scores and AIP risk levels, adjusting for potential confounding variables.  ResultsA significant inverse correlation exists between CVH scores and AIP risk levels (OR=0.51, 95%CI: 0.49-0.54, P<0.001). Higher CVH scores were associated with lower AIP risk levels, while lower CVH scores corresponded to elevated AIP risk levels.

However, most research has focused on high-income countries, leaving a gap in knowledge regarding the relationship between depression and CHF in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs). This study aimed to delineate depressive symptom trajectories and identify potential risk factors for poor outcomes among CHF patients.  MethodsLongitudinal data from 783 patients with CHF from public hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan was analyzed. Depressive symptom severity was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Baseline and 6-month follow-up BDI scores were clustered through Gaussian Mixture Modeling to identify distinct depressive symptom subgroups and extract trajectory labels. Further, a random forest algorithm was utilized to determine baseline demographic, clinical, and behavioral predictors for each trajectory.  ResultsFour depressive symptom trajectories were identified:  good prognosis,  remitting course,  clinical worsening, and  persistent course. Risk factors associated with persistent depressive symptoms included lower quality of life and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3 classification of CHF. Protective factors linked to a good prognosis included less disability and a non-NYHA class 3 classification of CHF.

Penney', 'Boulos Zacharie', 'Jean-Simon Duceppe']",Jean-Simon Duceppe (clpenney09@gmail.com),['1 ChemThera Sciences'],"Globally, approximately 39 million people are living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus, HIV, arising from approximately 86 million infections since this epidemic began in 1981. However, the number of HIV infections is unevenly distributed with two thirds of global infections confined to Sub-Saharan Africa. Due to viral drug resistance, the most effective treatment requires a triple drug combination thereby adding to the complexity and cost of therapy. As such, many people living with HIV or at risk of infection do not have access to prevention or treatment of this potentially fatal disease. There is no cure for HIV [1]. Tucaresol is an orally active clinical stage drug which functions as a host targeted antiviral agent by protection or reconstitution of CD4+ T helper immune cells. We report herein that Tucaresol also displays in-vitro activity against HIV in infected human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although this in-vitro antiviral activity is not potent, the excellent safety profile and bioavailability of Tucaresol, along with its low Molecular Weight, support attainment of relevant drug concentrations in man to achieve significant in-vivo activity. This is demonstrated by previously reported stabilization of viremia in a prior proof of concept phase 1b/2a HIV clinical trial [2]. It is possible that the significant in-vivo activity of Tucaresol arises from synergy between co-stimulation of CD4+ T helper cells and the direct activity against virally infected cells. A pan in-vitro viral screen of Tucaresol further revealed a weak, direct antiviral activity against human herpes virus 6B, human papillomavirus 11, measles virus and hepatitis B virus."

Many barriers to scholarship have been identified, but there are limited data on which are most important. A rank-order of barriers from learners perspectives would better enable programs to address perceived barriers.  MethodsGiven that learners are experts in their own perceptions, we applied the Delphi method of generating consensus expert opinion to construct ranked lists of physician-perceived barriers to scholarly activity at various sites. The survey was conducted within three separate health systems. Respondents were asked to identify their perceived barriers via free text and the listed barriers were consolidated by the research team. In the second round, respondents were presented with the consolidated lists and asked to rank them. In the third and final round, each respondent was shown a comparison of their own rankings to that of their peers and given an opportunity to make changes. Ranking differences between programs were compared using Rank Biased Overlap (RBO).  ResultsThe Delphi method is a straightforward method to obtain a ranked list of perceived learner barriers to scholarly activity; its primary limitation is learner engagement and, of note in our study, high dropout rates. RBO is an effective method of ranking differences between programs and specialties. Top barriers across programs included time, overwhelm with the research process, and lack of interest or energy.  DiscussionSeveral of the identified barriers may be addressed with enthusiastic mentors, streamlined administrative processes, and education. This could be done within a hospital system or on a national level through specialty organizations."

Suggestive associations (p<1x10-5) were observed in TMCO3 in EUR, in NEIL2 and CFAP44 in AFR, and in FAM210B in the cross-ancestry meta-analysis. Gene-based collapsing tests identified SLC22A10, TMCO3, FAM90A1, DHX58, CHRND, GLDN, PLAT, H1-4, COL3A1, GPHB5 and QPCTL as top genes (p<1x10-4) with most associations attributable to rare variants and driven by the burden of predicted loss-of-function and missense variants. This study begins to fill the gap in our understanding of the genetic architecture of OD, providing insights into the contribution of rare coding variants and potential targets for future functional studies and drug development."

Low vaccine uptake reduces the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns and threatens global public health. Understanding why adolescents are hesitant to accept new vaccines is therefore crucial to support the development of novel vaccine uptake interventions. Prior reviews have included far fewer citations, excluded qualitative data, studies after 2022 and have not mapped adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour onto psychological models. This systematic review investigated psychological factors influencing attitudes and intentions toward and uptake of Covid-19 vaccines in adolescents aged 10 to 19 years globally. It mapped results onto the COM-B framework to inform future interventions. Our search identified 25,354 citations, and included 77 in this review. The quality of studies was mixed, predominantly cross-sectional in design. According to our review, key influences on adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour were: i) Reflective motivation (safety concerns, perceived susceptibility to/severity of Covid-19, perceived vaccine effectiveness, ii) Social opportunity (social norms, autonomy and prosocial attitudes), iii) Psychological capability (attitude and knowledge about vaccines). Our review provides new insights into psychological factors influencing adolescent Covid-19 vaccine behaviour, and maps factors to the COM-B model of behaviour change. To improve vaccine uptake, future vaccine interventions should support adolescents to think critically about the pros and cons of vaccines and consider external influences on their decisions."

The Study of Asian Women and their Offsprings Development and Environmental Exposures (SAWASDEE) enrolled pregnant farmworkers from Thailand (n=248), who were primarily exposed to organophosphate (OP) and pyrethroid pesticides. We measured maternal urinary levels of six non-specific OP metabolites expressed as three summary measures (dimethylalkylphosphates (DMAP), diethylalkylphosphates (DEAP), and dialkylphosphates (DAP) and three pyrethroid metabolites (3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), cis- and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylic acid (Cis-DCCA, Trans-DCCA) during early, middle, and late pregnancy, and adjusted for urine dilution using creatinine. RNA-sequencing was used to profile the placental transcriptome from which 21 co-expression network modules were identified by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. Quantile g-computation analysis identified an average pregnancy positive mixture exposure effect on the E2f Target Module ({beta} = 0.013, p = 0.012) and a negative mixture exposure effect ({beta} = -0.016, p = 0.008) on the Myogenesis Module. The pesticide metabolites driving the associations differed for each module, highlighting differential susceptibilities within the placental transcriptome to various pesticides. When stratifying by infant sex, the average pregnancy mixture exhibited a significant negative effect ({beta}= -0.018, P=0.016) on the Myogenesis Module only in females; other modules, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition, though not demonstrating an overall mixture effect, did demonstrate differential impacts of the mixture by sex. Pesticide mixtures in both the second trimester ({beta} = -0.013, p = 0.015) and the third trimester ({beta} = -0.012, p = 0.028) exhibited consistently significant negative associations with the Myogenesis module.

Clinically relevant preconception information and clinical practice guidelines have since been developed to aid health professionals in preconception care delivery. This systematic review aimed to 1) synthesise recent literature (past five years) describing health professionals beliefs and attitudes towards preconception care services or programmes and 2) determine if the experience of health professionals providing preconception care has changed compared to literature reviews conducted more than five years ago.  MethodsFive databases were searched between 27/01/2016 and 27/01/2022. Primary quantitative and qualitative research studies were included if they examined health professionals beliefs and attitudes towards delivering preconception care services or programmes. Study quality was assessed using the CASP Checklist (qualitative studies) and AXIS tool (quantitative studies). Data synthesis used thematic categorisation adapted from the framework approach.  ResultsTwenty-one studies were included (n=8 qualitative, n=11 quantitative, n=2 mixed-methods studies). Methodological quality was generally good for qualitative studies but varied for quantitative studies. The results covered three categories: 1) addressing preconception care health literacy (i.e. lack of knowledge, awareness, training and resources), 2) clinical practicalities of preconception car e (i.e. need for coordination of care and clarity on role responsibility), and 3) the role of the patient (i.e. need for public health education to support patient-led conversations).  ConclusionsLittle has changed regarding the barriers and facilitators to providing preconception care reported by health professionals. To improve the provision of preconception care, there is a need to co-develop professional and public preconception health education, clinical resources, and a coordinated preconception healthcare service model."

Within communities the social environment may promote individual risk of infection for the school-aged children. There will also be demographic groups who are not targeted or reached by preventive chemotherapy campaigns. The behaviours of these other groups will interact with those of school-aged children, resulting in further infection risk through exposure-related behaviours. Furthermore, perception of the disease may significantly influence the schoolchildrens lived experience of the infection and associated disease. It is therefore crucial to document the daily experiences of schoolchildren living in schistosomiasis high transmission areas along Lake Albert, Hoima District.  MethodsAn ethnographic study explored schoolchildrens perspectives and daily life organisations that shape their risk of schistosomiaisis and their perceptions of the disease. The study was conducted between November 2022 and August 2023. It involved in-depth interviews with schoolchildren and their parents, key informant interviews, focus group discussions with schoolchildren, and participant observations. Data was analysed using a reflexive thematic analysis. Code reports were generated inductively using ATLAS.ti (Version 7).  ResultsThe study revealed a significant level of knowledge and awareness about schistosomiasis among schoolchildren. They had understanding of the risk factors, continued exposure, and experiences of illness, though they had little autonomy to address these through their own behaviour as they were influenced by the behaviour of others and macro-factors such as WASH provision and economic need. Study participants experienced individual-level effects of schistosomiasis such as educational impacts and isolation as a significant form of stigma.  ConclusionsThere is a need for continued community sensitisation and awareness campaigns to address social stigma, educational impact, and contamination and exposure-related behaviours. National and regional policies and programmes on WASH, livelihood and poverty eradication programmes need to be revisited in schistosomiasis high transmission areas to help provide alternatives and improve schoolchildrens lived experiences."

We observed effects within attention networks and the default mode network, but not in fronto-parietal networks, at the HC-based intermediate analysis level. No between-network FC differences were found. In the most detailed analysis level, we could not identify single affected functional connections. Despite statistical power limitations in this small sample, findings are in line with previously reported FC alterations in PKU and the cognitive profile in young adults with PKU, particularly with the still uncertain notion that cognitive control deficits might become less pronounced when PKU patients reach adulthood."

ObjectiveTo investigate the associations of the item-level response to Cognitive Function Index (CFI) by participant and study partner with tau pathology and adjusted hippocampal volume (HVa).  MethodParticipants were 339 cognitively unimpaired, A{beta} positive, individuals enrolled in the Anti-Amyloid Asymptomatic Alzheimers (A4) Study who underwent tau-PET imaging. Participants and their study partners assessed subjective changes in cognition and function over the past year using the 15-item CFI questionnaire. For each CFI item, the relationship among tau, HVa, and CFI reports was investigated.  ResultParticipants were on average 72.38 (SD = 4.87) years old, 58.1% were female, and 23.6% were tau positive. Higher tauMTL was significantly associated with participant report of decline on three CFI items including depending on written notes, seeing a doctor for memory concern, and feeling lost while navigating. Higher tauMTL was associated with study partner report of decline on two different items: needing help from others to remember appointments/occasions and asking same questions. Additionally, HVa was linked to challenges with driving for participants and noticeable memory decline for study partners.  ConclusionWe showed that early changes reported on specific items of the CFI are associated with higher tauMTL and lower HVa in A{beta}+ participants. Different CFI items were associated with tau and hippocampal volume for participants and study partners, highlighting the importance of both perspective."

Setting23 U.S. community and minority oncology practice sites affiliated with the National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP).  Participants521 patients ([&ge;]18 years) with MM or CLL were consented and 416 responded to a survey (completion rate=79.8%). Respondents had a MM diagnosis (74.0%), an associate degree or higher (53.4%), were White (89.2%), insured (100%) and treated with clinician-administered drugs (68.0%).  InterventionsObservational, prospective, protocol-based survey administered in 2019-2020.  Primary and secondary outcome measuresFinancial difficulty was assessed using a single-item standard measure, the EORTC QLQC30: ""Has your physical condition or medical treatment caused you financial difficulties in the past year?"" and using an  any-or-none composite measure of 22 items assessing financial difficulty, worries and the use of cost-coping strategies. Multivariable logistic regression models assessed the association between financial difficulty, diagnosis, and socioeconomic and treatment characteristics.  Results16.8% reported experiencing financial difficulty using the single-item measure and 60.3% using the composite measure. Most frequently endorsed items in the composite measure were financial worry about having to pay large medical bills related to cancer and difficulty paying medical bills. Financial difficulty using the single-item measure was associated with having MM versus CLL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.84; P=.02), having insurance other than Medicare (aOR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.37-4.66; P=.003), being non-White (aOR, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.04-4.72; P=.04), and having a high school education or below (aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.21-0.64; P=.001).

ConclusionsU.S. patients with blood cancer report financial difficulty, especially those with low socio-economic status. Evidence-based and targeted interventions are needed.  Study Strengths and LimitationsO_ST_ABSStrengthsC_ST_ABSO_LINCORP, a program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), is a national network for cancer clinical trials and care delivery studies that is comprised of 7 research bases and 46 community sites across the U.S., 14 of which are designated as Minority/Underserved community sites. The study had strong engagement and participation across diverse NCORP Sites across the country and their affiliates. Strong site engagement resulted in high patient recruitment and retention rates for this study (79.8%), despite coincident timing with the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. C_LIO_LIThe survey tool was composed of previously validated items that were modified for this population and new questions that were evaluated for comprehension, which facilitates comparison of our findings to others previously published. Patients targeted for recruitment were treated in the community and recruitment aimed to represent the socioeconomic characteristics of the prevalent patient population. The study relied on both self-report and medical chart abstraction to establish key dependent and independent variables. C_LIO_LIThe primary outcome variable was a previously developed, and empirically tested measure, supporting study internal and external validity. We also used a secondary composite measure of financial difficulty to present a more holistic picture of how cancer diagnosis and treatment impact patients daily lives and inform decisions to delay or forego care and use cost-coping strategies. By capturing specific worries, decisions and strategies, the composite measure indicates areas where there is a need for greater patient engagement and resource provision at the site of care. C_LI  LimitationsO_LIAmong 105 participants who were not included in the final sample, the majority (n=66) were excluded from analysis because they could not be contacted within the 8-week period due to unexpectedly high recruitment volumes across sites. C_LIO_LIWhile NCORP sites from across the country participated in the study, 60% of patients recruited to the study were from the Midwest. Although this is the most representative study of financial difficulty in U.S. blood cancer patients to date, our findings may not be fully generalizable to the national CLL and MM communities due to these limitations.

Subgrouping longitudinal symptom trajectories after FEP would be useful for developing personalized treatment approaches, and being able to predict these trajectories at baseline would facilitate individual-level treatment planning. We utilized k-means clustering to identify distinct clusters of 411 FEP patients based on longitudinal positive and negative symptom patterns. Ridge logistic regression was then used to identify predictors of cluster membership using baseline data. Three clusters were identified, demonstrating unique demographic, clinical and treatment response profiles. Cluster 1 exhibits lower positive and negative symptoms (LS), lower antipsychotic dose, and relatively higher affective psychosis; Cluster 2 shows lower positive symptoms, persistent negative symptoms (LPPN), and intermediate antipsychotic doses; Cluster 3 presents persistently high levels of both positive and negative symptoms (PPNS), as well as higher antipsychotic doses. We effectively predicted patients cluster membership (AUC of 0.74). The most important predictive features included contrasting trends of apathy, affective flattening, and anhedonia for the LS and LPPN clusters. Global hallucination severity, positive thought disorder and manic hostility predicted PPNS. These results help parse the heterogeneity of FEP trajectories and may facilitate the development of personalized treatment approaches tailored to cluster characteristics."

They need holistic intervention programs to face these problems and enhance their quality of life. This study developed and evaluated a cardiac and psychosocial rehabilitation (CPR) program for young adults with FC.  METHODS AND RESULTSThirty-eight young adults with FC aged 18-23 years were prospectively recruited from an outpatient clinic and randomized into a CPR group (n = 12) that underwent eight weekly group-based sessions combining a psychosocial program based on cognitive behavioral therapy with home-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR), a CR group (n = 12) that received only home-based CR, and a usual care control group (n = 12). The study assessed CPR program effectiveness based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, self-efficacy, quality of life, and exercise capacity testing at three time points: pre-intervention, post-intervention, and four weeks post-intervention. Participants average ages were 19.75 (2.28), 19.65 (1.79), and 20.38 (1.85) years in the CPR, CR, and control groups, respectively; 50% (CPR group) to 53.8% (CR and control groups) of the participants were male. After eight weeks, depression and anxiety decreased, whereas self-efficacy and quality of life increased in the CPR group compared with the CR and control groups. The groups showed no differences in exercise capacity.  CONCLUSIONCPR can be part of an intervention for alleviating psychological distress and improving self-efficacy in young adults with FC. Efforts should be made to increase the efficacy of home-based CR."

Occurrence of NDDs is thought to be determined by both genetic and environmental factors, but data on the role of environmental risk factors for NDD in Africa is limited. This study investigates environmental influences on NDDs in children from Kenya. This case-control study compared children with NDDs and typically developing children from two studies on the Kenyan coast that did not overlap.  Methods and FindingsWe included 172 of the study participants from the Kilifi Autism Study and 151 from the NeuroDev Study who had a diagnosis of at least one NDD and 112 and 73 with no NDD diagnosis from each study, respectively. Potential risk factors were identified using unadjusted univariable analysis and adjusted multivariable logistic regression analysis. Univariable analysis in the Kilifi Autism Study sample revealed hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy conferred the largest odds ratio (OR) 10.52 (95%CI 4.04 - 27.41) for NDDs, followed by medical complications during pregnancy (gestational hypertension & diabetes, eclampsia, and maternal bleeding) OR: 3.17 (95%CI 1.61 - 6.23). In the NeuroDev study sample, labour and birth complications (OR: 7.30 (2.17 - 24.61)), neonatal jaundice (OR: 5.49 (95%CI 1.61 - 18.72)) and infection during pregnancy (OR: 5.31 (1.56 - 18.11)) conferred the largest risk associated with NDDs. In the adjusted analysis, seizures before age 3 years in the Kilifi Autism study and labour and birth complications in the NeuroDev study conferred the largest increased risk. Higher parity, the child being older and delivery at home were associated with a reduced risk for NDDs.  ConclusionRecognition of important risk factors such as labour and birth complications could guide preventative interventions, developmental screening of at-risk children and monitoring progress. Further studies examining the aetiology of NDDs in population-based samples, including investigating the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, are needed."

Even though a disruption of the BCB is associated with higher symptom severity, factors linked to BCB disruption in SSDs have been minimally investigated.  To address this gap, 57 inpatients with SSD underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood analyses as well as comprehensive clinical assessments. In a subgroup of 28 participants structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed. We developed a BCB dysfunction score, employing principal component analysis of CSF/serum albumin, CSF/serum IgG ratios and total protein levels in CSF, with higher values indicating stronger abnormalities. We calculated multiple regression models to explore the associations between BCB integrity and cardiometabolic, inflammatory, brain morphometric, and clinical measures respectively.  BCB dysfunction score was negatively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and positively associated with total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. Furthermore, we observed a trend towards a positive association between BCB dysfunction score and treatment resistance that did not survive multiple testing correction. We did not find significant associations between the BCB composite score and any other assessed cardiometabolic, inflammatory or cerebroventricular measures.  These findings suggest that BCB integrity is associated with dyslipidemia in SSD, highlighting the interplay between cardiometabolic risk factors and brain health in SSD. Addressing cardiometabolic health in individuals with SSD might thus have implications beyond physical health, potentially influencing the integrity of the BCB and, consequently, clinical trajectories."

ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the relationship between epidermal melanin concentrations, determined by colorimetry, and discrepancies between arterial blood saturation (SaO2), determined by arterial blood gas (ABG), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) determined by pulse oximetry.  Design, Setting, ParticipantsThis observational, correlational study was conducted over a one-week period in 2024 at the University of the Incarnate Word School of Osteopathic Medicine. Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteers (14 male; 14 female) with varying skin pigmentation were recruited via convenience sampling. Participants with conditions affecting oxygen saturation were excluded.  ExposureParticipants underwent non-invasive pulse oximetry to measure peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) and invasive arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2). Melanin concentrations were measured using DSM III ColorMeter on the dorsal and palmar aspects of the hand. SpO2 was measured using the Masimo MightyStat(R) Rx Fingertip Pulse Oximeter, and ABG samples were analyzed using the i-STAT(R) 1 blood analyzer.  Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The primary outcome was the difference between SpO2 and SaO2 across varying melanin concentrations, hypothesized before data collection.  ResultsAnalysis revealed a significant difference between SaO2 and SpO2 with a moderately positive correlation with average epidermal melanin concentrations (r = 0.432; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.693; P = 0.022) and a moderately inverse correlation with average luminance (r = -0.492; 95% CI,- 0.731 to -0.145; P = 0.008). A strong inverse relationship was found between melanin and luminance (r = -0.85; 95% CI -0.928 to -0.698; P <0.001). PO2 emerged as the leading predictor in two regression models, explaining 50.5% of the variance when combined with melanin.  Conclusion and RelevanceTaken together, these data suggest that pulse oximetry overestimates oxygen saturation in individuals with comparatively high epidermal melanin concentrations. Future investigations that include a broader age range and participants with various comorbidities may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of epidermal melanin on the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow does epidermal melanin concentration affect the accuracy of pulse oximetry measurements compared to arterial blood gas results?  FindingsThis study found that higher epidermal melanin concentrations were associated with greater discrepancies between pulse oximetry and arterial oxygen saturation readings, suggesting that pulse oximeters may overestimate oxygen levels in individuals with darker skin tones.  MeaningHigher epidermal melanin concentrations may result in less accurate pulse oximetry measurements, potentially leading to misinterpretations of oxygen saturation in patients with darker skin tones, raising concerns about the accuracy of these devices across diverse populations."

Malaria control activities that have been implemented include early diagnosis and prompt treatment, provision of Long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), and indoor residual spraying (IRS). To expedite malaria elimination in this region, a rapid entomological assessment combined with human behaviour observations (HBOs) were conducted in eight high malaria endemic regencies in Papua Province, Indonesia. The present study focuses on identifying gaps in protection against mosquito biting indoors and outdoors that may contribute to the sustained transmission and persistently high endemicity.  MethodsThis study was conducted alongside a rapid entomologic assessment, including human landing catches (HLCs) of adult mosquitoes. Human behavior was documented by direct observations during HLCs. HBO data focused on temporal (over the night) and spatial (domestic or peri-domestic) presence, alongside bed net usage and sleeping patterns. Household questionnaires, also conducted during entomological collections, documented data on house structure materials, practices against mosquito bites, livestock presence, as well as intervention usage.  ResultsAnalysis of human behaviors in each regency identified several indoor and outdoor gaps in protection against mosquito biting. Human exposure to mosquito bites was driven by ITN usage, IRS coverage, indoor presence without protection prior to sleeping, absence of mosquito house screens, and outdoor presence without protection.  ConclusionsData demonstrates multiple gaps in protection against mosquito exposure in all eight regencies of Papua evaluated. Indoor interventions require optimization, while current vector control activities do not presently address outdoor exposure. Measured spatial and temporal exposure may be utilized to understand protective vector interventions that may function in these spaces while also pointing to continued exposure. Additional interventions, such as community-based larval source management, may reduce exposure overall, while novel interventions like spatial repellents may fill some gaps in protection - alongside optimized case detection and treatment. Results suggest that the present strategy may be insufficient to eliminate malaria in the region, and a rethought evidence-based and adaptive strategy is required."

This study was conducted to identify clusters of childhood mortality, causes of death of recently deceased children, barriers to care, and risk factors for mortality in Lusaka, Zambia.  MethodsThis study was conducted as a prospective cohort study. Family members or lawfully authorized representatives (LARs) were interviewed when they came to pick up death certificates for recently deceased children from Lusaka Childrens Hospital. Each interview included a verbal autopsy, determination of the childs location of residence, and collection of demographic information. Demographic data was also collected from a healthy control group. Quantitative Geographic Information Systems was used to visualize mortality and evaluate for clustering.  ResultsLeading primary causes of death included malnutrition (21%), complications of chronic illnesses (16%), and central nervous system infections (13%), while the leading barriers to care were cost (58%) and difficulties with travel (53%). Compared to controls, recently deceased children came from families with significantly lower incomes (1905 Kwacha vs. 2412 Kwacha, p = 0.03) and were significantly more likely to have a history of malnutrition (16.7% vs. 1.4%, p = 0.005).

Researchers have not extensively studied the effectiveness and user experience of this program. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of harm reduction programs in mitigating adverse effects of drug use, such as disease transmission and overdose. This in- depth study looked at what program users went through in the NYFC harm reduction program. This was done by looking at the program environment, unexpected outcomes, reasons for seeking services, and obstacles to access. The study used a phenomenological approach, utilising semi-structured interviews with 13 participants and analysing interview data using thematic analysis2 through NVivo. The motivations for seeking services were safety, access to clean supplies, and a non-judgmental environment. Findings revealed that users valued a safe and welcoming atmosphere fostered by friendly, supportive, and non- judgmental staff. The programs positive outcomes included reduced harm, access to resources, and emotional support. Nevertheless, limited operating hours, stigma, small space, and a lack of awareness were identified as barriers to access. The study recommends improving accessibility, enhancing support systems, and addressing unanticipated outcomes like drug use enablement to optimise the programs effectiveness. This study provides valuable insights into user experience within the NYFC program. The findings inform program improvements, enhance service delivery, and contribute to a broader understanding of harm reduction strategies for addressing the opioid crisis.

Dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is a preferred imaging modality for capturing dynamic images of respiration since dMRI does not involve ionizing radiation and can be obtained under free-breathing conditions. Using 4D images constructed from dMRI of sagittal locations, diaphragm segmentation is an evident step for the said quantitative analysis of LHD and RHD in these 4D images.  MethodsIn this paper, we segment the LHD and RHD in three steps: recognition of diaphragm, delineation of diaphragm, and separation of diaphragm along the mid-sagittal plane into LHD and RHD. The challenges involved in dMRI images are low resolution, motion blur, suboptimal contrast resolution, inconsistent meaning of gray-level intensities for the same object across multiple scans, and low signal-to-noise ratio. We have utilized deep learning (DL) concepts such as Path Aggregation Network and Dual Attention Network for the recognition step, Dense-Net and Residual-Net in an enhanced encoder-decoder architecture for the delineation step, and a combination of GoogleNet and Recurrent Neural Network for the identification of the mid-sagittal plane in the separation step. Due to the challenging images of TIS patients attributed to their highly distorted and variable anatomy of the thorax, in such images we localize the diaphragm using the auto-segmentations of the lungs and the thoraco-abdominal skin.  ResultsWe achieved an average{+/-}SD mean-Hausdorff distance of [~]3{+/-}3 mm for the delineation step and a positional error of [~]3{+/-}3 mm in recognizing the mid-sagittal plane in 100 3D test images of TIS patients with a different set of [~]430 3D images of TIS patients utilized for building the models for delineation, and separation. We showed that auto-segmentations of the diaphragm are indistinguishable from segmentations by experts, in images of near-normal subjects. In addition, the algorithmic identification of the mid-sagittal plane is indistinguishable from its identification by experts in images of near-normal subjects.  ConclusionsMotivated by applications in surgical planning for disorders such as TIS, we have shown an auto-segmentation set-up for the diaphragm in dMRI images of TIS pediatric subjects. The results are promising, showing that our system can handle the aforesaid challenges. We intend to use the auto-segmentations of the diaphragm to create the initial ground truth (GT) for newly acquired data and then refining them, to expedite the process of creating GT for diaphragm motion analysis, and to test the efficacy of our proposed method to optimize pre-treatment planning and post-operative assessment of patients with TIS and other disorders."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been playing an important role by noninvasively assessing structural and functional muscular changes. This exploratory study investigated the potential of dynamic MRI during neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to detect differences between healthy controls (HCs) and patients with metabolic and myotonic myopathies. The study included 14 HCs and 10 patients with confirmed muscular diseases. All individuals were scanned with 3T MRI with a protocol that included a multi-echo gradient echo sequence for fat fraction quantification, multi-echo spin-echo for water T2 relaxation time calculation, and 3D phase contrast sequences during NMES. The strain tensor, buildup and release rates were calculated from velocity datasets. Results showed that strain and strain buildup rate were reduced in the soleus muscle of patients compared to HCs, suggesting these parameters could serve as biomarkers of muscle dysfunction. Notably, there were no significant differences in fat fraction or water T2 measurements between patients and HCs, indicating that the observed changes reflect alterations in muscle contractile properties that are not reflected by structural changes. The findings provide preliminary evidence that dynamic muscle MRI during NMES can detect abnormalities in muscle contraction in patients with myotonia and metabolic myopathies, warranting further research with larger, more homogeneous patient cohorts."

They may be the family budget holders who purchase menstrual materials, receive health information outside the household, or preserve social stigmas. In response, World Vision, supported by UNICEF, implemented a programme to influence non-menstruators among the Rohingya population living in Kutupalong refugee camp, Bangladesh. The intention was to ensure non-menstruators recognise their important role in supporting family members to improve their menstrual health. We evaluated this intervention using a baseline and endline survey of 150 participants based on the Risk-Attitudes-Norms-Ability-Self-regulation (RANAS) approach to behaviour change. Based on the responses, we categorised participants into  doers and  non-doers of positive behaviours. We then performed multiple linear regression analyses and ANOVA comparison of means tests to understand how psychosocial and contextual factors influence the populations attitudes and behaviours towards menstruation before and after intervention. The regression analyses showed eight psychosocial and contextual factors that had a significant relationship with the desired behaviours. These were the block they lived in, marital status, already having learnt about menstruation from World Vision, how they were introduced to menstruation, who they discuss menstruation with, family members reaction, perceptions of their role, and their commitment. Additionally, the ANOVA comparison of means between doers and non-doers showed doers were more likely to be confident to carry out the behaviour, perceive their role as important, and discuss menstruation with family. They were also more likely to be married, older, and have first learnt about menstruation from their family. This is the first study to identify which psychosocial and contextual factors significantly influence positive non-menstruator attitudes and conducive behaviours towards menstruation and menstruators.

Although spinal cord stimulation (SCS) stands as the primary FDA-endorsed method for neuromodulatory therapy in CLBP, there remains a subset of patients unresponsive to SCS and others who experience insufficient pain relief over time. In view of the evidence suggesting the critical role of subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) connectivity in pain processing, in the current study we investigated the role of the baseline SCC structural as a potential neuroimaging predictive biomarker to identify patients that are likely to benefit from SCS.  MethodsDiffusion magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired in 8 patients with CLBP (mean (SD) age = 70 (10) years; 6 female/2 male, 6 UCLA site, 2 UTSW) before their initial SCS trial. Probabilistic tractography from subject-specific anatomically defined SCC seed regions to the ventral striatum (VS), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), uncinate fasciculus (UCF) and bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was used to calculate FSL structural probabilistic connectivity in the target network. To explore cross-sectional variations in SCC connectivity related to SCS trial response, we employed a general linear model (GLM) using the SCC probability of connectivity as dependent variable, and the response to the SCS trial as independent variable. We used Pearson correlation to evaluate further the relationships between the critical SCC probability of connectivity and the change in VAS score after the SCS trial. Finally, the role of depression in the treatment outcome was evaluated.  ResultsResponders to SCS had significantly lower ipsilateral SCC connectivity to mPFC (F1,8 =8.19, p = 0.03) and VS (F1,8 =17.48, p=0.01) on the left hemisphere compared to non-responders. Pearson correlation analysis showed that decreased ipsilateral SCC baseline connectivity to left mPFC (p=0.03) and VS (p=0.01) was correlated with higher improvement in VAS scores. The baseline depression severity did not significantly influence the change in VAS score following the SCS trial. On the other hand, baseline SCC-VS connectivity on the left hemisphere was a significant predictor of change in VAS score (p=0.02).  ConclusionsOur study highlights the important role of SCC connectivity that can serve as a potential biomarker for CLBP stratification and prediction to SCS treatment. These results can reshape our perspective on CLBP management and can serve as early indicator of response to the treatment providing a personalized approach based on the individuals underlying SCC connectivity."

Plasma proteins represent a promising source of biomarkers, therefore understanding the causal relationships between specific plasma proteins and PCa could be conductive to identify novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for PCa prevention and treatment.  MethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of two independent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) including 94,397 individuals with PCa and 192,372 controls. A mendelian randomization (MR) supplemented by colocalization analysis was conducted, using cis-acting variants on 4,907 plasma proteins from deCODE Genetics (N=35,559) and 2,940 plasma proteins from UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP) (N=54,219). Then, the biological pathway analysis and druggability evaluation of the risk proteins were further performed.  ResultsFive possible susceptibility loci (JAZF1, PDILM5, WDPCP, EEFSEC, and TNS3) for PCa were identified through the meta-analysis of GWASs. Among 3,722 plasma proteins, 193 proteins were associated with PCa risk, of which 20 high-risk proteins, including KLK3, were validated in both the deCODE and UKB-PPP cohorts. Functional annotation of these genes encoding proteins confirmed enrichment of immune response, inflammatory response, cell-cell interaction and so on. Genetic colocalization and druggable genome analyses also identified several potential drug targets for PCa, such as HSPB1, RRM2B and PSCA.  ConclusionsWe identified novel variants as well as several protein biomarkers linked to PCa risk and indicated pathways associated with PCa, which offered new insights into PCa etiology and contributed to development of novel biomarkers for early detection and potential therapeutic interventions.

Unlike previous rare variant studies in lipids, this study included 238,243 individuals (20.6%) from non-European-like populations.  Testing 2,997,401 rare coding variants from diverse backgrounds, we identified 800 exome-wide significant associations across 209 genes including 176 predicted loss of function and 624 missense variants. Among these exome-wide associations, 130 associations were driven by non-European-like populations. Associated alleles are highly enriched in functional variant classes, showed significant additive and recessive associations, exhibited similar effects across populations, and resolved pathogenicity for variants enriched in African or South-Asian populations. Furthermore, we identified 5 lipid-related genes associated with coronary artery disease (RORC, CFAP65, GTF2E2, PLCB3, and ZNF117). Among them, RORC is a potentially novel therapeutic target through the down regulation of LDLC by its silencing.  This study provides resources and insights for understanding causal mechanisms, quantifying the expressivity of rare coding alleles, and identifying novel drug targets across diverse populations."

Ketone esters (KEs) are compounds that induce hyperketonemia without dietary changes and that may impact physical and cognitive function in young adults. The functional effects of KEs have not been studied in older adults.  ObjectivesOur long-term goal is to examine if KEs modulate aging biology mechanisms and clinical outcomes relevant to frailty in older adults. Here, we report the exploratory functional and quality-of-life outcome measures collected during a 12-week safety and tolerability study of KE (NCT05585762).  DesignRandomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, parallel-group, pilot trial of 12-weeks of daily KE ingestion.  SettingThe Clinical Research Unit at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, California. Participants: Community-dwelling older adults ([&ge;] 65 years), independent in activities of daily living, with no unstable acute medical conditions (n = 30).  InterventionSubjects were randomly allocated (1:1) to consume 25 g daily of either KE (bis-octanoyl (R)-1,3-butanediol) or a taste, appearance, and calorie-matched placebo (PLA) containing canola oil.  MeasurementsLongitudinal change in physical function, cognitive function and quality of life were assessed as exploratory outcomes in n = 23 completers (n = 11 PLA, n = 12 KE). A composite functional outcome to describe the vigor-frailty continuum was calculated. Heart rate and activity was measured throughout the study using digital wearables.  ResultsThere were no statistically significant longitudinal differences between groups in exploratory functional, activity-based or quality of life outcomes.  ConclusionDaily ingestion of 25 g of KE did not affect exploratory functional or quality-of-life end points in this pilot cohort of healthy older adults. Future work will address these endpoints as primary and secondary outcomes in a larger trial of pre-frail older adults."

Earlier identification of critically ill children at risk for incurring neurologic morbidity would facilitate heightened surveillance that could lead to timelier clinical detection, earlier interventions, and preserved neurodevelopmental trajectory.  ObjectiveDevelop machine-learning models for identifying acquired neurologic morbidity while hospitalized with critical illness and assess correlation with contemporary serum-based, brain injury-derived biomarkers.  DesignRetrospective cohort study.  SettingTwo large, quaternary childrens hospitals.  ExposuresCritical illness.  Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe outcome was neurologic morbidity, defined according to a computable, composite definition at the development site or an order for neurocritical care consultation at the validation site. Models were developed using varying time windows for temporal feature engineering and varying censored time horizons prior to identified neurologic morbidity. Optimal models were selected based on F1 scores, cohort sizes, calibration, and data availability for eventual deployment. A generalizable created at the development site was assessed at an external validation site and optimized with spline recalibration. Correlation was assessed between development site model predictions and measurements of brain biomarkers from a convenience cohort.  ResultsAfter exclusions there were 14,222-25,171 encounters from 2010-2022 in the development site cohorts and 6,280-6,373 from 2018-2021 in the validation site cohort. At the development site, an extreme gradient boosted model (XGBoost) with a 12-hour time horizon and 48-hour feature engineering window had an F1-score of 0.54, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.82, and a number needed to alert (NNA) of 2. A generalizable XGBoost model with a 24-hour time horizon and 48-hour feature engineering window demonstrated an F1-score of 0.37, AUROC of 0.81, AUPRC of 0.51, and NNA of 4 at the validation site. After recalibration at the validation site, the Brier score was 0.04. Serum levels of the brain injury biomarker glial fibrillary acidic protein measurements significantly correlated with model output (rs=0.34; P=0.007).  Conclusions and RelevanceWe demonstrate a well-performing ensemble of models for predicting neurologic morbidity in children with biomolecular corroboration. Prospective assessment and refinement of biomarker-coupled risk models in pediatric critical illness is warranted.  Key PointsQuestion Can interoperable models for predicting neurological deterioration in critically ill children be developed, correlated with serum-based brain-derived biomarkers, and validated at an external site?  Findings A development site model demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.82 and a number needed to alert (NNA) of 2. Predictions correlated with levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein in a subset of children. A generalizable model demonstrated an AUROC of 0.81 and NNA of 4 at the validation site.

Switching from a PI- to an II-based regimen was associated with improved adherence (72% vs. 92%, p=0.01) and an undetectable viral load (67% vs. 78%).  ConclusionsSwitching CAWH from PI-based to II-based regimens has many advantages including superior side effect profiles, adherence, and viral suppression. PI taste aversion may be a significant contributor to pediatric adherence issues. Palatability should be considered in pediatric HIV drug development."

Methods208 children/adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV and 208 HIV-exposed uninfected controls were recruited in Zambia for this prospective cohort study. EF was measured using performance-based, self-report, and parental report measures. Adherence over one year of follow-up was assessed through questionnaires and viral load measurement.  ResultsChildren with HIV performed significantly worse on all three measures of EF. Lower parental rating of EF was associated with poorer antiretroviral therapy adherence (OR: 1.5, 95% CI = 1.02 - 2.2, p = 0.04).  ConclusionChildren with HIV have EF impairments which may lead to consequences like poor medication adherence and treatment failure. Interventions to improve EF or compensate for impaired EF may be necessary in this population."

Yet, little is known about drug overdose patterns among Asian American and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (AANHPI) populations.  MethodsWe obtained data on drug overdose deaths and population totals from the CDC WONDER Multiple Cause of Death database and American Community Survey between 2018 and 2022. We calculated crude mortality rates per 100,000, stratified by sex, US Census Division, and drug types--prescription opioids, heroin, fentanyl, cocaine, methamphetamine, and benzodiazepines. Additionally, we conducted disaggregated analyses for six Asian American subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese) and three NHPI subgroups (Hawaiian, Guamanian, Samoan).  ResultsIn 2022, there were 1226 drug overdose deaths among Asian Americans and 154 among NHPI individuals. The crude mortality rate for NHPI individuals (17.52 per 100,000; 95% CI: 14.76- 20.29) tripled that of Asian Americans (5.85 per 100,000; 95% CI: 5.52-6.18). Fentanyl was the leading cause of overdose deaths among Asian Americans (3.17 per 100,000; 95% CI: 2.93- 3.41), whereas methamphetamine was predominant among NHPI individuals (11.38 per 100,000; 95% CI: 9.15-13.61). Among Asian American subgroups, Japanese Americans had the highest mortality rate (9.90 per 100,000; 95% CI: 9.61-10.2), and among NHPI subgroups, Guamanians had the highest rates (43.16 per 100,000; 95% CI: 39.05-48.24).  ConclusionsThese findings underscore the urgent need for culturally competent harm reduction services, mental health and addiction treatment, and social services, addressing structural barriers that perpetuate drug overdose disparities in AANHPI communities."

We previously established the Milieu Interieur cohort to define the boundaries of healthy immune responses and identify and quantify its different determinants. From this cohort of 1,000 well-defined healthy donors, we have identified multiple genetic and environmental factors that are associated with variable immune phenotypes. Crucially, these associations were observed in a healthy context, as defined by strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. To assess how such immune responses may vary over time, we initiated a 10-year follow-up clinical study of the cohort. From the original 1,000 donors, we identified and recruited 415 donors from whom we assessed recent medical history and lifestyle factors, in addition to collecting samples for measurement of diverse immune phenotypes. A comparison of 107 laboratory and serological measures over the 10-year period showed significant correlations, highlighting the quality of the data collected. By accounting for potential batch effects, our analyses revealed the profound effects of aging on health-related biomarkers and antibody levels against common pathogens. We determined that a significant proportion of the donors no longer meet the initial definition of good health, due to either physiological changes associated with aging, or disease incidence including cancer, autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases. We found that disease development over the past 10 years is associated with a biological aging score, assessed at the time of the initial recruitment. In summary, the Milieu Interieur follow-up study will provide new opportunities for studying biological mechanisms of immunosenescence and identifying factors associated with accelerated immune aging and poor health outcomes."

Although there is increasing emphasis on introducing palliative care for patients with HF, it is not well characterized where adults with HF spend their final days before death.  STUDY AIMThis study analyzed the locations and circumstances of death among adults with HF in the United States using data from the CDC-WONDER database.  METHODOLOGYThe study examined mortality data of individuals aged [&ge;] 20 years, with HF listed as the underlying cause of death between 1999 and 2023. The place of death was categorized as the emergency room (ER), hospice/nursing home, inpatient medical facility, or home. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between death location and demographic factors.  RESULTSFrom 1999 to 2023, HF-related deaths decreased from 1999 (3.60% and 143.6 AAMR) to 2010 (3.47% and 123.1 AAMR). From 2010 onwards, a gradual rise is seen, with the rate of HF deaths reaching 5.18% and 168.1 AAMR in 2023. Notably, deaths at home increased from 18.41% (50,648 of 275,132) in 1999 to 33.47% (132,470 of 395,826) in 2023 and deaths in hospice/nursing homes increased from 30.95% (85,144 of 275,132) in 1999 to 34.71% (116,634 of 336,014) in 2017 and then sudden fall was observed until 2023 to 29.54% (116,931 of 395,826). Older adults (65+) were more likely to die in inpatient facilities. Gender, ethnicity, and urbanization influenced the place of death, with males, White patients, and those residing in large metropolitan areas more likely to die in medical facilities.  CONCLUSIONSThis study highlights the changing patterns in the locations of death among HF patients, emphasizing the need for improved home and hospice care services. Addressing disparities in healthcare access and enhancing palliative care are essential for improving end-of-life experiences. Further research is needed to investigate the factors that contribute to these trends."

This systemic immune response could potentially influence the immune status of the skin, particularly in conditions like dermatitis. Despite extensive research on dermatitis, the causal relationship between cholecystitis and dermatitis subtypes (DSs) remains unclear.  ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to investigate the causal relationship between cholecystitis and DSs.  MethodsTwo-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was used to analyze the causal relationship between cholecystitis and DSs. We then utilized the Bayesian Weighted Mendelian Randomization (BWMR) method to validate our findings and applied bidirectional MR analysis to confirm the causal direction. After establishing the associations between traits, we delved into the underlying mechanisms of this interesting finding. Subsequently, we used 91 inflammatory proteins as mediators and performed summary data-based mendelian randomization (SMR) analysis to further investigate the pathogenesis of DSs.  ResultsMR results evidently showed that cholecystitis can significantly reduce the risk of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) (IVW, OR=0.8834, p=0.0368) and exfoliative dermatitis (ED) (IVW, OR=0.5738, p=0.0126). BWMR also provided secondary validation of the casual associations. In the subsequent reverse direction MR analyses, reverse causality was not present, so cholecystitis had a unidirectional effect and existed as a protective factor for ACD and ED. Interestingly, cholecystitis appears to lower the risk of ACD and ED by downregulating IL-6, IL-7, and IFN-{gamma}. Additionally, the genes HCG27 and HLA-DRB5 may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ACD.  ConclusionThis study used a two-step MR analysis of genetic summary data to investigate to what extent inflammatory proteins impact the protective role of cholecystitis on dermatitis. We also identified several proteins and genes that could serve as potential drug targets.

Many of those children suffer from sensory processing disorders (SPD). There is no standardized treatment for this disorder and the therapies available have produced confusing and conflicting results. A search was performed for relevant studies and systematic review articles that researched treatment in this area. Data was extracted and analyzed and then organized with summary conclusions of each paper. Qualitative notes were gathered on the studies and the results of the studies were compared and contrasted. Sensory integration therapy has been shown to produce significant results and most of the conflicting data can be explained scientifically. Research is still required for the duration frequency and rate of therapy. Reviews of other therapies to treat SPD have not shown enough evidence of significant positive outcomes to be recommended.  Purpose StatementThe purpose of this paper is to gather and analyze research regarding therapies for Sensory Processing Disorder in Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This review aims to determine the evidence of such therapies and to inform and educate practitioners regarding outcomes in their use to treat this disorder.

Prior demographic surveys in English-speaking countries (e.g., Canada and the United States) suggest that SLPs gender, racial, linguistic, and cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds may not be aligned with those of their clientele. The aim of this study is to describe the demographic characteristics of current SLP students, to gauge whether the demographic composition of future clinicians is changing and is aligned with the population they are trained to serve. We designed an anonymous online survey, in the Canadian context, that enabled us to compare current SLP student demographics with statistics available about the target population at large. This survey was disseminated to all SLP students enrolled in an accredited institution in 2024. Participants answered questions about their age, sex and gender, linguistic, racial and cultural identities, and socioeconomic status. More than half (N=525, 53%) of currently enrolled SLP students completed the survey. Results indicate that SLP students are overwhelmingly cisgender females. SLP students spoke 48 unique languages, and while most were bi or multilingual, few felt competent enough in languages other than English and French to engage in clinical service delivery. There were 151 unique racial and ethnic identities reported, with the largest proportion of students identifying as ""North American."" Culturally most SLPs identified as ""Canadian."" Very few students identified as Black or Indigenous racially or culturally. Most respondents reported a higher-than-average total household income. Findings suggest that the demographic composition of current SLP students is more diverse than those currently practicing, however there is still over-, and underrepresentation of certain populations. Implications for practice and suggestions for future research are discussed."

MethodScientific papers were initially obtained from bibliographic database searches using a Boolean search strategy with pre-defined keywords. From 15,839 unique records, three reviewers manually identified 39 relevant papers based on pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the ChatGPT experiment, over 10% of records were randomly chosen as the experimental dataset, including the 39 manually identified manuscripts. These unique records (n=1,680) underwent screening via ChatGPT-4 using the same prespecified criteria. Four strategies were employed including standard prompting, i.e., input-output (IO), chain of thought with zero-shot learning (0-CoT), CoT with few-shot learning (FS-CoT), and Majority Voting (which integrates all three promoting strategies). Performance of the models were assessed using recall, F-score, and precision measures.  ResultsRecall scores (% of true abstracts successfully identified and retrieved by the model from all input data/records) for different ChatGPT configurations were 0.82 (IO), 0.97 (0-CoT), and both the FS-CoT and the Majority Voting prompts achieved a recall score of 1.0.

CONCLUSIONSOur results suggest a need to improve comprehensive glycemic and CVD risk factor management for individuals living with diabetes in Mexico to improve diabetes care and reduce risk of adverse outcomes."

Approximately 2-7% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) develop PSC. No drug has been shown to prevent de novo PSC in patients with IBD. Statin use, however, has been associated with increased liver transplant-free survival. Yet, the impact of statins on development of new PSC among those with IBD is unknown.  MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with IBD with and without statin exposure using a large, representative national database. Patients were followed from the date of diagnosis of IBD. Patient demographics, co-morbidities, medications, and type of IBD were extracted. Unmatched and propensity score-matched Cox regression analyses were performed.  ResultsOur analysis included 33,813 patients with IBD of whom 8,813 were exposed to statins. PSC developed in 181 patients over a median follow-up of 3.7 years. Only nine patients (0.1%) who were exposed to statins developed PSC compared to 173 (0.69%) in the non-exposed population. In propensity score-matched analysis, statin therapy was associated with an 86% lower risk of developing PSC (HR 0.14; 95% CI 0.06-0.33, p<0.001). The findings were consistent when accounting for unmeasured confounders (E-value) in sensitivity analyses, including stratification by age group, duration of statin use, and type of statin.  ConclusionIn a propensity score-matched analysis, statin use was associated with an 86% risk reduction in new PSC diagnosis among patients with known IBD, suggesting a potential benefit as a prophylactic agent. These findings warrant prospective validation."

However, in Papua New Guinea (PNG), about 40% of newborns are not breastfed within the first hour of birth. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and factors associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation in PNG.  MethodsThis study utilised secondary data from the 2016-2018 PNG Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), a nationally representative cross-sectional study. A total weighted sample of 4748 women aged 15-49 were included. Complex samples analysis was performed to determine the direction of association between the independent variables and delayed initiation of breastfeeding.  ResultsAbout a quarter (24.6%) of women delayed initiation of breastfeeding. Women with an unplanned pregnancy (AOR 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.68), those who had a caesarean section (AOR 3.16; 95% CI: 1.39 to 7.17), those who did not initiate newborn skin-to-skin contact immediately after birth (AOR 1.83; 95% CI: 1.41 to 2.38), and those who watched television (AOR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.75), or were from the Momase region (AOR 1.31; 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.93) had higher odds of delayed breastfeeding initiation. Conversely, those who read a newspaper or magazine (AOR 0.76; 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.95), were from the Southern (AOR 0.81; 95% CI: 0.56 to 1.15) and Highlands (AOR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.58 to 1.29) regions, and gave birth at home or in the village (AOR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.96) had lower odds of delayed initiation of breastfeeding.  ConclusionOne in four women in this study delayed initiation of breastfeeding until after one hour after birth. Interventions to promote optimal breastfeeding require a multi-sectoral approach, as well as bolstering health workers capacity to encourage and support early initiation of breastfeeding during the antenatal and early postnatal periods.

The investigation of rare CNVs is impeded by low sample size. To understand the mechanisms through which CNVs influence human health, common variation in the genomic region of the CNV from large samples could be used as a proxy.  MethodsUtilising genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics of 20 traits, we assessed the cumulative effect of common genetic variants in eight genomic regions containing pathogenic CNVs, using MAGMA gene-based analysis. We used GSA-MiXeR to estimate the fold enrichment of these CNV regions for the specific phenotypes.  ResultsThe distal and proximal regions of the 16p11.2 CNV exhibited the highest number of significant associations and were enriched for the highest number of traits: 12 of 27 significant MAGMA associations (44%) were enriched. These CNV regions also had the highest number of phenotype-associated genes related to ion transport, signalling, transcriptional regulation, development, and protein metabolism. We compared the significance of all the genomic regions and the genes in these regions and found two opposing patterns: 1) cumulative value of separate genes, resulting in the higher significance of the whole region than of the particular genes; 2) higher significance of the specific genes that drive the association of the whole region.  ConclusionsCharting the features of genomic regions encompassing CNVs might aid in clarifying CNVs role in human disease, especially pinpointing candidate genes within these regions that are associated with complex traits."

Pastoral women are particularly impacted, as they are the primary caretakers of sheep and goats. While managing livestock can empower women, prevailing gender norms may limit this potential. This study aimed to explore womens experiences in taking on responsibility for animal health and to analyse the challenges and opportunities presented by PPR intervention projects.  Eight focus group discussions were conducted with women from three districts in the Somali region of Ethiopia, supplemented by twelve key informant questionnaires and one key informant interview. Qualitative data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, while quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics.  The research findings present one overarching theme:  The importance of womens sovereignty in PPR vaccination, along with two main themes. The first theme,  Navigating hierarchies and the feminisation of responsibility, comprises the subthemes  Women in responsibility,  Cultural norms and masculinities, and  Men losing track. This theme highlights womens predominant roles in livestock management, household chores, and income generation, while it also explores traditional gender roles and the impacts of mens khat consumption. The second main theme,  Knowledge privilege, dilemmas, and gaps, encompasses the subthemes  Knowledge for empowerment,  Dilemmas despite knowledge, and  Challenges due to training gaps. This theme explores womens empowerment through PPR training, underscores the critical importance of unhindered access to PPR vaccines and effective cold chain maintenance, addresses challenges such as vaccine hesitancy and antimicrobial usage, and stresses the need for community-based training initiatives.  The study emphasises a shift from the traditional gendered division of labor toward an increased burden of responsibility on women, a trend that appears to have been reinforced by anti-poverty programs and further intensified by mens khat consumption. Training in animal health, particularly in PPR vaccination, has been identified as an area where women are eager to engage. To support this, the study recommends adopting  train-the-trainer and community-based approaches, while ensuring access to resources. These strategies must be gender-responsive to empower women in PPR management and reduce their workloads in the long term.  One health impact statementThis research highlights the importance of involving pastoral women in managing Peste des petits ruminants (PPR), a viral disease that significantly affects sheep and goats. It also emphasises the risk of overburdening women in poverty reduction efforts and stresses the need for gender-responsive initiatives to reduce their workload in the long term.  By empowering women in animal health management through such initiatives, both animal health and the livelihoods and food security of rural communities are improved. This underscores the value of a One Health approach, which integrates human, veterinary, and social sciences to comprehensively address health challenges.  The research was made possible through long-standing trust relationships between NGO staff and communities, which facilitated strong community engagement. The qualitative and reflexive approach to data analysis enabled the voices of affected individuals to be heard, allowing for the co-production of knowledge and enhancing the researchs societal relevance."

However, they remained at risk for subsequent neurological deterioration even after intravenous thrombolysis. The efficacy of endovascular treatment (EVT) in iICAO patients remains uncertain. Recently, some retrospective studies revealed EVT for acute iICAO was safe and might confer potential benefits. Our aim was to identify the hypoperfusion profiles associated with neurological deterioration and functional outcome following EVT in iICAO patients.  MethodsWe performed a multi-center, real-world cohort study involving acute symptomatic iICAO patients who underwent EVT from August 2018 to February 2024 across 3 stroke centers. Hypoperfusion profiles were assessed using Tmax volumes (>4s, >6s, >8s, and >10s) and Tmax mismatch ratios (>10s/>8s, >10s/>6s, >10s>4s, >8s/>6s, >8s/>4s, and >6s/>4s). Neurological deterioration was defined as an increase of [&gt;=]4 points in the NIHSS score prior to EVT. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Score 0 - 1 at 90 days.  ResultsA total of 63 patients were included in the final analysis. Multivariable models showed that a lower Tmax ratio of >6s/>4s was an independent predictor for increased risk of neurological deterioration (OR, 0.003; 95% CI: 0.000-0.133; P = 0.003) and was associated with a better outcome following EVT (OR, 0.066; 95% CI: 0.005-0.874; P = 0.039) after adjustment. The optimal threshold for the Tmax >6s/>4s ratio was identified as 0.5.  ConclusionsA perfusion defect severity ratio of Tmax >6s/>4s less than 0.5 might indicate the likelihood of neurological deterioration, yet it would be associated with achieving a good outcome following EVT for iICAO patients. The hypoperfusion profile characterized by a Tmax >6s/>4s might be useful to the neurointerventionists for facilitating appropriate patient triage and guiding prognosis for EVT in iICAO patients."

Maintaining realistic expectations towards exoskeleton use and ensuring the appropriate selection of users is important for intervention coherence. In general, there was a positive perception regarding effectiveness and self-efficacy. Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies focused primarily on measuring acceptability, revealing an important gap in the literature.  ConclusionsThe acceptability of exoskeletons among people with SCI and HP tends to be positive, which is promising for the sustainable implementation of this technology. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the acceptability of HP, with only two studies conducted among this population. It is crucial to persevere in documenting the acceptability of exoskeletons, notably by standardizing comprehensive approaches for measuring acceptability, and to continue refining this technology."

Due to potential occupational health risks, public health institutions now recommend wiping, which is labor-intensive and may increase the risk of heat stress for healthcare workers wearing personal protective equipment. This systematic review and meta-analysis quantified the health effects of occupational exposure to chlorine-based products compared to other disinfectants, and the effects of spraying compared to general disinfection tasks (GDTs) like wiping and mopping, in healthcare settings.  Data sources, design and eligibility criteriaMEDLINE, Scopus, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies addressing the association between exposure to disinfectants applied by different application methods and occupational diseases in healthcare settings. Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers using a validated tool.  Data extraction and synthesisTwo reviewers independently screened and performed data extraction and synthesis. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. Meta-analyses were conducted using fixed- and random-effects models based on the Higgins I{superscript 2} statistic.  Results30 studies investigating chlorine-based products (7,123 participants), glutaraldehyde (6,256 participants), peracetic acid, acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide (4,728 participants), quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) (9,270 participants), use of spray (4,568 participants) and GDTs (3,480 participants) were included. Most had a cross-sectional design and high risk of bias. Meta-analysis indicates a significant association between respiratory conditions and exposure to chlorine-based products (OR 1.71, 95%CI 1.41- 2.08), glutaraldehyde (OR 1.44, 95%CI 1.14-1.81), QACs (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.06-1.60), use of spray (OR 25, 95%CI 1.61-3.14) and GDTs (OR 2.20, 95%CI 1.66-2.90). The relative odds ratio (ROR) of respiratory conditions for chlorine-based products compared to QACs was 0.76 (95%CI 0.62-0.94). The ROR for the use of spray compared to GDTs was 0.98 (95%CI 0.74-1.29). Strengths include evaluating respiratory health risks of disinfectants, applying a validated tool, using both fixed- and random-effects models, and comparing pooled effect sizes. Limitations include high risk of bias for the majority of included articles, varying confounder adjustments, underreported non-respiratory outcomes, and unspecified disinfectants and PPE use for spray and GDTs articles.  ConclusionChlorine-based disinfectants significantly increase respiratory risk compared to QACs. Sprays and general disinfection tasks present similar risks. Our findings advocate for using less hazardous products like QACs, rather than banning sprays in filovirus outbreak responses to enhance disinfection safety.

Ultrasound is a commonly employed modality in the screening and preliminary diagnosis of endometrial cancer. However, false-positive ultrasound results can lead to misdiagnosis, patients have to bear unnecessary distress, expensive examination costs, examination injuries and other adverse consequences; while false-negative ultrasound results will result in delayed treatment, and patients will thus have to bear the adverse consequences of a poor prognosis, high treatment costs, poor quality of life and short survival. It is imperative to identify convenient, cost-effective and non-invasive diagnostic techniques to minimize the prevalence of false positives and false negatives in uterine ultrasound. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic efficacy of YiDiXie-SS and YiDiXie-HS in the context of endometrial cancer.  Patients and methodsThe final number of study subjects included in this study was 74, comprising 58 cases of malignant disease and 16 cases of benign disease. The remaining serum samples from the subjects were collected and tested using the YiDiXie all-cancer detection kit, with the objective of evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of the YiDiXie-SS and YiDiXie-HS, respectively.  ResultsThe sensitivity of YiDiXie-SS was 98.3% (95% CI: 90.9% - 99.9%) and its specificity was 62.5% (95% CI: 38.6% - 81.5%). YiDiXie-HS had a sensitivity of 82.8% (95% CI: 71.1% - 90.4%) and its specificity was 81.3% (95% CI: 57.0% - 93.4%). The sensitivity of YiDiXie-SS in patients with a positive uterine ultrasound was 95.0% (95% CI: 76.4% - 99.7%), while the specificity was 75.0% (95% CI: 30.1% - 98.7%). This indicates that the utilisation of YiDiXie-SS has the potential to reduce the incidence of false-positive uterine ultrasound results by 75.0% (95% CI: 30.1% - 98.7%), while simultaneously minimising the likelihood of malignancy leakage. The YiDiXie-HS in patients with a negative uterine ultrasound was 81.6% (95% CI: 66.6% - 90.8%), while the specificity was 83.3% (95% CI: 55.2% - 97.0%). This suggests a reduction of 81.6% (95% CI: 66.6% - 90.8%) in the rate of false-negative uterine ultrasound with the application of YiDiXie-HS.  ConclusionYiDiXie  -SS is an effective method for reducing the rate of uterine ultrasound false positives while maintaining a low incidence of delayed treatment of malignancies. YiDiXie-HS has been demonstrated to significantly reduce the rate of false-negative uterine ultrasound results. YiDiXie-SS and YiDiXie-HS have significant diagnostic value in endometrial cancer, and are expected to solve the two problems of  high false positive rate of uterine ultrasound and  high false negative rate of uterine ultrasound in endometrial tumors.

Many GxG interactions have been identified in model organisms through experimental breeding studies, but they have been difficult to identify in human populations. To address this challenge, we applied two complementary variance QTL (vQTL)-based approaches to identify GxG interactions that contribute to human blood traits and blood-related disease risk. First, we used the previously validated genome-wide scale test for each trait in [~]450,000 people in the UK Biobank and identified 4 vQTLs. Genome-wide GxG interaction testing of these vQTLs enabled discovery of novel interactions between (1) CCL24 and CCL26 for eosinophil count and plasma CCL24 and CCL26 protein levels and (2) HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 for lymphocyte count and risk of celiac disease, both of which replicated in [~]140,000 NIH All of Us and [~]70,000 Vanderbilt BioVU participants. Second, we used a biologically informed approach to search for vQTL in disease-relevant genes. This approach identified (1) a known interaction for hemoglobin between two pathogenic variants in HFE which cause hereditary hemochromatosis and alters risk of cirrhosis and (2) a novel interaction between the JAK2 46/1 haplotype and a variant on chromosome 14 which modifies platelet count, JAK2 V617F clonal hematopoiesis, and risk of polycythemia vera. This work identifies novel disease-relevant GxG interactions and demonstrates the utility of vQTL-based approaches in identifying GxG interactions relevant to human health at scale."

However, the causality of this relationship remains uncertain. Additionally, there is a lack of studies investigating the association between glycemic traits and imaging-based thoracic aortic phenotypes.  ObjectiveWe investigated whether T2DM and glycemic measures (fasting glucose (FG), fasting insulin (FI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and 2-hour post-load glucose (2hPG)) are causally associated with various imaging and clinical thoracic aortic phenotypes.  Design, setting, and participantsWe performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies of glycemic traits (GT) and aortic phenotypes. We employed a two-sample univariate MR (UVMR) followed by a multivariable MR and MR analysis using a cluster-based approach.  Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe outcome includes imaging-based ascending and descending aortic diameters (AAoD and DAoD), aortic distensibility (AoDist) and strain (AoStr), and thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection (TAAD). The GT include FI, FG, HbA1c, 2hPG and T2DM.  ResultsWe observed an inverse association between 2hPG, FG, HbA1c, and T2DM and AAoD, DAoD. For instance, the genetically predicted increases levels of 2hPG, FG, HbA1c, and T2DM were associated with decreased AAoD (2hPG {beta}= -0.2, p=3x10-08; FG {beta}= -0.21, p=5x10-05; HbA1c {beta}= -0.36, p=2x10-07; T2DM {beta}=-0.04, p=2x10-04) and reduce risk TAAD (2hPG decreased TAAD (2hPG OR= 0.70, p=4x10-04; FG OR= 0.58, p=3x10-05; HbA1c OR= 0.62, p=5x10-03; T2DM OR= 0.90, p=6x10-6). Further investigation showed that the inverse association between T2DM and aortic phenotypes is driven by genetic predictors of T2DM beta cell proinsulin clusters. UVMR and Proteomic MR showed a strong association with aortic phenotypes for genes, such as AGER, GLRX, TCF7L2, and GCK, which are known to play an important role in glucose regulation.  Conclusion and relevanceOur findings suggest a potentially causal impact of GT on the aortic vasculature. Furthermore, specific glucose regulation genes such as GCK, AGER, and TCF7L2 appear to contribute to this process, opening avenues for potentially leveraging the druggability of these genes for treatment or preventions of TAAD."

Meta-SAIGE reduces type I error inflation through precise estimation of the distribution of test statistics and allows the reuse of the linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrix across phenotypes, significantly improving computational efficiency for phenome-wide analyses. Simulation studies using UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing (WES) genotypes demonstrate that Meta-SAIGE effectively controls type I error rates and yields power similar to that of pooled individual-level data through SAIGE-GENE+. A meta-analysis of UK Biobank and All of Us WES data for 83 low prevalence disease phenotypes identified 237 associations.

Little is known, however, about the impacts of school-entry age on adolescent health in low- and middle-income countries where most children and adolescents worldwide reside.  MethodsData on childrens outcomes were extracted from the longitudinal Young Lives Study in Vietnam, conducted between 2001 and 2016 (N=1,532), and the Vietnam Population and Housing Censuses of 1989, 1999, and 2009 (N=1,595,365). In Vietnam, children need to turn six years old by December 31st to enter Grade 1 in September that school year. As a result of the school-entry age policy, children born on or before December 31st start school one year earlier compared to children who are born just after December 31st. Using exposure to the policy as an exogenous instrument for school-entry age, we used two-stage least squares regressions to determine the causal effect of school-entry age on education and health outcomes by age 23 years. We considered pre-primary education, school attendance, time spent in school, childbearing, marriage or cohabitation, as well as anthropometric measurements.  ResultsChildren born after the school-entry age cut-off were more likely to have participated in pre-primary education and were more likely to be in school when compared to children born before the cut-off. A one-year increase in age at the beginning of Grade 1 because of the policy was associated with an increase in the probability of pre-primary education of 13 percentage points (95% CI: 7.8-18.5), daily time spent in school of 0.9 hours (95% CI: 0.5-1.4) and a reduced probability of having an own child of 25.3 percentage points (95% CI: 4.4-46.2). We observed a qualitatively smaller and statistically non-significant relationship between school-entry age and measured body mass index. These results were generally consistent when using alternative specifications of our model, sample, survey rounds, and data sources.  DiscussionChildren who are older when entering primary school stayed in school longer and postponed family formation compared to children who entered school earlier because of the school-entry age policy in Vietnam. Relative age for grade should be considered when designing sexual and reproductive health interventions and programs targeted to adolescents."

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable abilities to understand, reason, and retrieve information from unstructured data sources (such as plain text), presenting the opportunity to transform clinical data into accessible information for clinical or research purposes.  ObjectiveWe present PANDORA, an AI system comprising two LLMs that can extract data and use it with risk calculators and prediction models for clinical recommendations as the final output.  MethodsThis study evaluates the models ability to extract clinical features from actual clinical discharge notes from the MIMIC database and synthetically generated outpatient clinical charts. We use the PUMA calculator for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) case finding, which interacts with the model and the retrieved information to produce a score and classify patients who would benefit from further spirometry testing based on the 7 items from the PUMA scale.  ResultsThe extraction capabilities of our model are excellent, with an accuracy of 100% when using the MIMIC database and 99% for synthetic cases. The ability to interact with the PUMA scale and assign the appropriate score was optimal, with an accuracy of 94% for both databases. The final output is the recommendation regarding the risk of a patient suffering from COPD, classified as positive according to the threshold validated for the PUMA scale of equal to or higher than 5 points. Sensitivity was 86% for MIMIC and 100% for synthetic cases.  ConclusionLLMs have been successfully used to extract information in some cases, and there are descriptions of how they can recommend an outcome based on the researchers instructions. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first model which successfully extracts information based on clinical scores or questionnaires made and validated by expert humans from plain, non-tabular data and provides a recommendation mixing all these capabilities, using not only knowledge that already exists but making it available to be explored in light of the highest quality evidence in several medical fields."

Among these, silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) are particularly valued for their biocompatibility and adaptability in applications like drug delivery and medical imaging. However, predicting SiNP biodistribution and clearance remains a significant challenge. To address this, we developed a minimal physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (mPBPK) model to simulate the systemic disposition of SiNPs, calibrated using in vivo PK data from mice. The model assesses how variations in surface charge, size, porosity, and geometry influence SiNP biodistribution across key organs, including the kidneys, lungs, liver, and spleen. A global sensitivity analysis identified the most influential parameters, with the unbound fraction and elimination rate constants for the kidneys and MPS emerging as critical determinants of SiNP clearance. Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) further revealed that aminated SiNPs exhibit high accumulation in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, while mesoporous SiNPs primarily accumulate in the lungs. Rod-shaped SiNPs showed faster clearance compared to spherical NPs. The mPBPK model was extrapolated to predict SiNP behavior in humans, yielding strong predictive accuracy with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.98 for mice and 0.92 for humans. This model provides a robust framework for predicting the pharmacokinetics of diverse SiNPs, offering valuable insights for optimizing NP-based drug delivery systems and guiding the translation of these therapies from preclinical models to human applications."

Housing interventions that aim to improve housing and reduce environmentally mediated infections, such as finished floors and housing upgrades for vector-borne diseases, remain relatively under-explored as health interventions. This study explored facilitators of and barriers to funding, implementing, and scaling up housing improvements as health interventions to reduce environmentally mediated infectious diseases.  MethodsSixteen key informants (KIs) with direct experience in implementing or working within housing interventions and environmentally mediated infectious diseases in low- and middle-income countries were interviewed using a semi-structured interview format. KIs had diverse backgrounds, including academics researching housing interventions, housing policy advisors, and practitioners implementing housing interventions. A thematic analysis approach was used to identify key themes in interview transcripts, highlighting patterns, commonalities, and variations in participants responses.  ResultsKIs emphasized the multi-dimensional impacts of housing interventions that are intrinsically linked to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including physical and mental health, as well as environmental, social, and economic dimensions. Moreover, a pronounced shortage of funding and financial systems to address housing interventions was highlighted, alongside the urgent need for more rigorous evidence and cost-benefit analyses. Furthermore, the imperative to raise awareness of the significance of housing and the critical importance of strong collaboration across sectors and stakeholders were stressed. Emphasizing the necessity for project-based and context-specific housing policies, the interviews revealed that contextualizing interventions to their specific setting and fostering community involvement are essential for successful implementation and scale-up.  ConclusionsHousing interventions play a pivotal role in mitigating environmentally mediated diseases. These interventions can complement existing strategies like water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions, ensuring comprehensive approaches to healthy housing and sustainable development goals amidst climate change."

In Kenya, regional studies have approximated the prevalence to range from 37% to 50%. However, these studies have been done in specific regions or population groups, such as among urban residents or women. Therefore, we aimed to assess the general and sex-specific prevalence and determinants of central obesity among adults in Kenya.  MethodsAn analysis of the prevalence and determinants of central obesity was assessed using data from the 2015 Kenya STEPwise survey on non-communicable diseases and injuries. We included a final sample of 4 003 participants. Participants characteristics and prevalence of central obesity were described and summarized using frequencies and percentages. The bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess the determinants of central obesity.  ResultsThe overall weighted prevalence of central obesity was 46.7% [95% confidence interval (CI): 43.2, 50.3], with women exhibiting a significantly higher prevalence compared to men (58.3% vs. 35.6%, p=0.001). Sex, age, household wealth index, and smoking were among the factors significantly associated with central obesity. Men had 66% lower odds of central obesity compared to women, while the risk increased with age, ranging from 1.6 to 4 times higher odds among those aged 30--39 and 50--69 years, respectively, compared to 18--29-year-olds. Other predictors of central obesity were wealthier households and non-smoking.  ConclusionAbout half of the adult Kenyan population is centrally obese, with a higher prevalence among women than men. Kenyas policymakers should consider targeting high-risk groups in this population to reduce the burden of central obesity."

Since then, 6 eligible RCTs have completed, including one large trial (n=15,804).  MethodsUpdated systematic review and meta-analysis of data from RCTs of vitamin D for ARI prevention using a random effects model. Sub-group analyses were done to determine whether effects of vitamin D on risk of ARI varied according to baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration, dosing regimen or age. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Science and the ClinicalTrials.gov were searched between May 2020 (previous search) and April 2024. No language restrictions were imposed. Double-blind RCTs supplementing vitamin D for any duration, with placebo or low-dose vitamin D control, were eligible if approved by Research Ethics Committee and if ARI incidence was collected prospectively and pre-specified as an efficacy outcome. Aggregate data, stratified by baseline 25(OH)D concentration and age, were obtained from study authors. The study was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42024527191).  FindingsWe identified 6 new RCTs (19,337 participants). Data were obtained for 16,086 (83.2%) participants in 3 new RCTs and combined with data from 48,488 participants in 43 previously identified RCTs. For the primary comparison of any vitamin D vs. placebo, the intervention did not significantly affect overall ARI risk (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.00, P=0.057; 40 studies; I2 26.4%). Pre-specified subgroup analysis did not reveal evidence of effect modification by age, baseline vitamin D status, or dosing regimen. Vitamin D did not influence the proportion of participants experiencing at least one serious adverse event (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.04; 38 studies; I2 0.0%). A funnel plot showed left-sided asymmetry (P=0.002, Eggers test).

In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we evaluated the effect of BA on patients up to 12 months after COVID-19, characterized by reduced pulmonary function, dyspnea, and decreased oxygen saturation.  MethodsPatients (n=392) were randomized 1:1 to receive BA (3000U) or placebo every 5 days for 71 days. Percent of predicted forced vital capacity (ppFVC), respiratory symptoms, and exercise tolerance indicators were assessed at baseline and on days 71 and 180.

Our previous work discovered a blood-based DNA methylation prognostic signature (PLAT-M8) that uses 8 CpG sites related to chemoresistance. We aim to validate this biomarker and its correlation with clinicopathological features and treatment profiles in additional cohorts.  MethodsExtracted DNA from whole blood was provided from the BriTROC 1 (n=47) and OV04 cohorts (n=57) upon the first relapse. Additional samples from Hammersmith Hospital (n=100) were collected during first-line chemotherapy (cycles 3-4 and 6). Bisulphite pyrosequencing was used to quantify DNA methylation at the previously identified 8 CpG sites. The methylation data obtained were combined with previous data from ScoTROC 1D and 1V (n=141) and OCTIPS (n=46). Cox regression was used to assess overall survival (OS) after relapse concerning clinicopathological characteristics. The DNA methylation Class (Class 1 vs 2) was determined by consensus clustering.  FindingsBlood DNA methylation at relapse predicts better clinical outcomes. Methylation Class shows no association with outcome during first-line chemotherapy treatment. Methylation Class 1 is associated with shorter survival, as indicated by a meta-analysis of five cohorts (OS: HR 2.54, 1.67-3.85). Class 2 patients on carboplatin monotherapy have the best prognosis, while Class 1 patients on the same treatment have the poorest prognosis (OS: aHR 9.69, 2.38-39.47). Class 1 is linked to older patients (>75 years) with advanced-stage, platinum-resistant cases, correlating with residual disease, and shorter progression-free survival. In contrast, Class 2 of PLAT-M8 is linked to platinum-sensitive patients, and higher complete response rates by RECIST criteria, but shows no correlation with CA-125. These findings emphasise the potential of PLAT-M8 in guiding second-line chemotherapy decisions.  InterpretationPLAT-M8 methylation biomarker is associated with survival in OC patients with relapse and hypothetically may predict platinum treatment response at second-line chemotherapy.  FundingThis work was supported by funding from Ovarian Cancer Action (""Risk and Prevention"" programme grant), Cancer Research UK programme grant (A13086) with support from the Cancer Research UK Imperial Centre, the National Institute for Health Research Imperial Biomedical Research Centre and the Ovarian Cancer Action Research Centre.  Research in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThere is a strong association between platinum-based chemotherapy and DNA methylation changes in blood DNA during ovarian cancer relapse. Previous findings identified eight specific CpG methylation changes (known as PLAT-M8) in blood at relapse following platinum-based chemotherapy that were associated with overall survival in patients enrolled in the ScoTROC 1 trial and the OCTIPS cohort. Using an ovarian cancer cell line model, the study also showed that functional DNA mismatch repair increased the frequency of platinum-induced methylation, providing insights into the observed epigenetic changes.  Added values of this studyOur current study validates in five large relapsed ovarian cancer cohorts that: (1) PLAT-M8 is associated with various clinicopathological characteristics, such as age, stage, platinum sensitivity, RECIST response, and progression time; (2) PLAT-M8, particularly from blood samples taken at the time of the first relapse before second-line chemotherapy, can serve not only as prognostic indicators for overall survival but also time to death after relapse in ovarian cancer patients; (3) PLAT-M8 does not have prognostic value when blood samples are taken during first-line chemotherapy before relapse, after initial diagnosis; and (4) PLAT-M8 may stratify overall survival and time to death after relapse based on the second-line treatment received by patients. These findings pave the way for our ongoing research, showcasing the potential of this non-invasive approach in predicting second-line treatment response, guiding decisions, and enhancing outcomes for relapsed ovarian cancer patients.  Implications of all the available evidenceThe lack of biomarkers guiding treatment decisions during second-line therapy highlights the need for more reliable biomarkers. As a prognostic biomarker, PLAT-M8 is considered simple yet impactful, as it only requires one blood sample taken before second-line treatment at the time of relapse. The advantages of this research include developing personalised treatment approaches, minimizing side effects and wasted time from ineffective medications, reducing the likelihood of subsequent relapse episodes, and improving clinical outcomes for patients. Ultimately, the use of biomarkers has the potential to reduce hospital stays and healthcare costs by optimizing treatment effectiveness and efficiency, while also enhancing the quality of life for patients."

MethodsIn this study, we conducted a retrospective clinical study of 545 children aged 8-12 years with myopia who were wearing orthokeratology lenses for one year and performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for 60 participants in two groups, one with rapid axial length progression of larger than 0.33 mm and the other with slow axial length progression of less than 0.09 mm. Genes in the RetNet database were used to screen candidate genes that may contribute to the effectiveness of orthokeratology lenses in controlling myopia.  ResultsWe found that children with a greater baseline eye axial length, greater spherical equivalent (SE) and greater age had better myopia control with orthokeratology. We observed a significant excess of nonsynonymous variants among those with slow myopia progression, which were prominently enriched in retinal disease related genes. We subsequently identified RIMS2 (OR=0.01, p=0.0075) and LCA5 (OR=6.96, p=0.0080) harboring an excess number of nonsynonymous variants in patients with slow progression of high myopia. Two intronic common variants rs36006402 in SLC7A14 and rs2285814 in CLUAP1 were strongly associated with axial length growth. Together, our finding identified novel genes associated with the effectiveness of orthokeratology lenses therapy in myopic children and provide insight into the genetic mechanism of orthokeratology treatment.  ConclusionThe effectiveness of orthokeratology lenses treatment involved interindividual variability in controlling axial length growth in myopic eyes. The efficacy increased when patients carried more nonsynonymous variants in retinal disease-related gene sets. Our data will serve as a well-founded reference for genetic counseling and better management of patients who choose orthokeratology lenses to control myopia."

SettingParticipants with RPD, drusen, or controls from the UK Biobank (UKBB), a large, multisite, community-based cohort study.  MethodsA previously validated deep learning framework was deployed on 169,370 optical coherence tomography (OCT) volumes from the UKBB to identify cases with RPD and/or drusen and controls without these phenotypes. Cases were included if they were 60 years or older, with at least 5 lesions. Five retina specialists manually validated the cohorts using OCT and color fundus photographs. Quantifications of RPD and drusen derived by the framework were used as variables. Two primary genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were performed to explore potential genetic associations with number of RPD and drusen within  pure cases, where only RPD or drusen were present in either eye. A candidate approach was furthermore adopted to assess 46 previously known AMD loci. Secondary GWAS were undertaken for number of RPD and drusen in mixed cases, as well as binary case-control analyses for pure RPD and pure drusen. Genome-wide significance was defined as p<5e-8.  ResultsA total of 1,787 participants were identified and analysed, including 1,037 controls, 361 pure drusen, 66 pure RPD and 323 mixed cases. The primary pure RPD GWAS yielded four genome-wide significant loci: rs11200630/ARMS2-HTRA1 (p=1.9e-09), rs79641866/PARD3B on chromosome 2 (p=1.3e-08), rs143184903/ITPR1 on chromosome 3 (p=8.1e-09), and rs76377757/SLN on chromosome 11 (p=4.3e-08). The latter three are all uncommon variants (minor allele frequency <5%). A significant association at CFH was also observed adopting a candidate approach (p=1.8e-04).  Two loci reached genome-wide significance for the primary pure drusen GWAS: rs10801555/CFH on chromosome 1 (p=6.0e-33) and rs61871744/ARMS2-HTRA1 on chromosome 10 (p=4.2e-20). For the mixed RPD and drusen secondary analyses, lead variants at both the CFH and ARMS2-HTRA1 loci reached genome-wide significance, with C2-CFB-SKIV2L additionally associated for mixed drusen alone. Findings from the binary case-control GWAS for drusen mirrored those of the primary drusen analysis, however no variants reached genome-wide significance in the case-control RPD GWAS.  ConclusionsOur findings indicate a clear association between the ARMS2-HTRA1 locus with higher RPD load. Although the association at the CFH locus did not reach genome-wide significance, we observed a suggestive link. We furthermore identified three novel associations that are unique to RPD, albeit for uncommon genetic variants. These findings were only observable when quantifying RPD load as a continuous trait, which increased the studys statistical power. Further studies with larger sample sizes are now required to explore the relative contributions of AMRS2-HTRA1 and CFH to RPD development, and to explore the validity of these newly presented RPD-specific genetic associations."

In this study, we performed discovery genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) on the RAG using the 31271 UK Biobank participants and replicated our findings in 8034 GoDARTs participants. The genetic correlation between RAGs predicted from the two cohorts was 0.67 (P=0.021).

This study investigated the application of signal processing and machine learning to electroencephalography (EEG) data for the development of classification algorithms capable of differentiating subjects in pain from pain free subjects. In this study, nineteen (19) channels of EEG data were obtained from subjects in an eyes closed resting state, and ultimately data from 186 participants were used for algorithm development, including 35 healthy controls and 151 chronic pain patients. Signal processing was applied to identify noise free segments of EEG data and 6375 quantitative EEG (qEEG) measures were calculated for each subject. Various machine learning methodologies were applied to the data, with Elastic Net chosen as the optimal methodology. The final classifier developed using Elastic Net contained 34 qEEG features with non-zero weights. The classifier was able to differentiate pain versus no pain subjects with an accuracy of 79.6%, sensitivity of 82.2%, and specificity of 66.7%. The features used in the classifier were evaluated and found to align well with contemporary literature regarding changes in neurological characteristics associated with chronic pain."

However, there is very little knowledge about stroke recovery genetics. Recently, some GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies) have highlighted the involvement of common or low-frequency variants near or within PATJ, PPP1R21, PTCH1, NTN4 and TEK genes, whereas the role of rare variants is still unclear. This study aims to identify the genetic contributions to differences in stroke outcome analyzing the effect of rare variants.  METHODSWe performed a pilot study analyzing 90 exomes of extreme good or bad recovery (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months 0-1 vs 4-5) to select target genes involved in stroke recovery. To expand this study, 702 additional samples were sequenced by Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing capturing loci selected from the pilot study, GWAS studies and literature input. Here, we performed continuous (mRS 0-6) and dichotomous (mRS 0-1 vs 3-6) analyses, yielding one candidate gene. Protein structure and stability analysis were performed on selected variants.  RESULTSOur work identified rare coding variants in VNN2 associated with patients with a better stroke recovery ({Delta}DIC > 10, equivalent to p-value < 0.001). Six rare variants were predicted to significantly affect protein stability ({Delta}{Delta}G > 1.6 kcal/mol), meanwhile, another variant, located in the active site, could affect the electrostatic surface.  CONCLUSIONSVNN2 could play a role in post-stroke inflammation altering the cell adhesion and migration of neutrophils during recovery."

Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies may overcome these challenges, potentially qualifying as a first-tier test for all rare diseases. To test this hypothesis, we performed LRS (30x HiFi genomes) for 100 samples with 145 known clinically relevant germline variants that are challenging to detect using short-read sequencing and necessitate a broad range of complementary test modalities in diagnostic laboratories.  We show that relevant variant callers readily re-identify the majority of variants (120/145, 83%), including [~]90% of structural variants, SNVs/InDels in homologous sequences and expansions of short tandem repeats. Another 10% (n=14) was visually apparent in the data but not automatically detected. Our analyses also identified systematic challenges for the remaining 7% (n=11) of variants such as the detection of AG-rich repeat expansions. Titration analysis showed that 89% of all automatically called variants could also be identified using 15-fold coverage.  Thus, long-read genomes identified 93% of pathogenic variants that are most challenging to detect using short-read technologies. Even with reduced coverage, the vast majority of variants remained detectable, possibly enhancing cost-effective diagnostic implementation. Most importantly, we show the potential to use a single technology to accurately identify all types of clinically relevant variants."

Despite the critical role that characteristics such as health attitudes and vaccination status play in disease outcomes, the initialization of agent populations with these variables is often oversimplified, overlooking statistical relationships between attitudes and other characteristics or lacking spatial heterogeneity. Leveraging population synthesis methods to create populations with realistic health attitudes and protective behaviors for spatial ABMs has yet to be fully explored. Therefore, this study introduces a novel application for generating synthetic populations with protective behaviors and associated attitudes using public health surveys instead of traditional individual-level survey datasets from the census. We test our approach using two different public health surveys (one national and the other representative of the study area, Virginia, U.S.) to create two synthetic populations representing individuals aged 18 and over in Virginia, U.S., and their COVID-19 vaccine attitudes and uptake as of December 2021. Results show that integrating public health surveys into synthetic population generation processes preserves the statistical relationships between vaccine uptake and attitudes in different demographic groups while capturing spatial heterogeneity at fine scales. This approach can support disease simulations that aim to explore how real populations might respond to interventions and how these responses may lead to demographic or geographic health disparities. Our study also demonstrates the potential for initializing agents with variables relevant to public health domains that extend beyond infectious diseases, ultimately advancing data-driven ABMs for geographically targeted decision-making.  Author SummaryIn this study, we introduce a new method for generating synthetic populations of individuals or ""agents"" with characteristics that include health protective behaviors and attitudes, which are crucial for modeling disease spread. Traditional methods for parameterizing agents often overlook the complex relationships between demographic factors and health behaviors like vaccination. Additionally, detailed spatial data capturing these behaviors are limited, meaning agent behaviors are more uniform across geographic space. By fitting public health surveys with spatially aggregated census data, we created more realistic agent populations for disease spread simulations. We focused on Virginia, U.S. and generated a population with COVID-19 vaccine uptake and attitudes as of December 2021. Our results show that this approach captures the statistical relationships between demographic variables and vaccine uptake, along with the spatial variation in these behaviors. We also show that using national survey data is comparable to using local survey data representative of Virginia collected in 2021. The approach is flexible so that it can be applied to various public health studies beyond just infectious diseases. Our work highlights the potential of public health surveys for enhancing synthetic population generation, offering a valuable approach for initializing models with more realistic populations to explore public health challenges."

MethodsWe performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the interaction between HIV and vaginal bacterial colonization and associations with birth weight and preterm birth. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, African Journals Online, and PubMed databases to identify studies published up to December 31, 2023. We included observational reporting on vaginal colonization with bacterial pathogens stratified by HIV status that reported pregnancy outcomes. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and used a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects modeling in STATA Version 18. Pooled log-odds ratios were calculated. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO(CRD42023485123).  ResultsWe selected 13 studies, involving 6,073 pregnant women, from 5,807 studies identified. The overall pooled prevalence of bacterial colonization was 26%(95%CI:17.3-37.4). There was no significant effect of HIV status and vaginal colonization on birth weight(OR=1.2, 95%CI:-2.57-2.20, p=0.88) and borderline increased odds of preterm birth (OR=2.64, 95%CI:-0.01-1.94, p=0.05). There was no significant association between HIV status and bacterial colonization(OR=1.08, 95%CI =-0.91-1.07), nor in antimicrobial resistance between pregnant women with HIV and those without.  ConclusionBacterial colonization is prevalent among pregnant women, but there is no clear evidence to suggest that HIV and bacterial colonization interact to affect birth weight or preterm birth. Research with large sample sizes, strict selection criteria, reliable and valid measurement, adequate control for confounding variables, and birthweight and gestational age at delivery assessment as continuous outcomes are still needed to provide robust evidence."

To minimize onsite processing, we developed Cryo-PRO (Cryopreservation with PBMC Recovery Offsite), a method of PBMC isolation from cryopreserved whole blood that allows immediate onsite sample cryopreservation and subsequent PBMC isolation in a central laboratory prior to sequencing. We compared scRNA-seq results from samples processed using Cryo-PRO versus standard onsite Ficoll separation in 23 patients with sepsis. Critical scRNA-seq outputs including cell substate fractions and marker genes were similar for each method across multiple cell types and substates, including an important monocyte substate enriched in patients with sepsis (Pearson correlation 0.78, p<0.001; 70% of top marker genes shared). Cryo-PRO reduced onsite sample processing time from >2 hours to <15 minutes and was reproducible across two enrollment sites, thus demonstrating potential for expanding scRNA-seq in multicenter studies of sepsis and other diseases."

However, the mechanisms underlying the functional improvements are poorly understood. This study investigated the effects of partial, continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support on cardiac function and mechanics in patients with PPCM of different severity. Patient-specific biventricular finite element models of six PPCM patients (four recovered, two non-recovered) were developed from magnetic resonance images and combined with a circulatory system model, including variable LVAD support. Ventricular function and myocardial mechanics were predicted, and changes due to LVAD support were quantified. The LVAD support decreased myofiber stress and increased ejection fraction (EF) of the LV. EF increased steadily (two patients), fluctuated (two patients), or peaked before a steady decrease (two patients) with increasing LVAD speed. Improvement due to LVAD support was greater for PPCM patients with higher disease severity than those with lower disease severity. The LVAD and native LV jointly generated stroke volume (SV) in four patients, and the LV contribution diminished with increasing LVAD speed. In the two patients with the lowest EF, the LVAD was the sole source of SV. The improvement of cardiac function and mechanics due to LVAD support in PPCM exceeds that reported for chronic heart failure due to ischemia. However, the predicted variability of the LVAD benefits with PPCM severity and mechanical support level suggests the need and potential for further studies to guide clinicians in selecting personalised treatment parameters required for optimised LVAD therapy for each PPCM patient.  Key points summaryO_LIPartial continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) therapy has presented positive outcomes for critically ill patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM), but the underlying LVAD mechanisms are poorly understood. C_LIO_LIThis study showed greater functional improvement for patients who did not recover than those who recovered from PPCM. C_LIO_LIIn patients with severe functional impairment, the LVAD provides the entire ventricular output at all speeds, whereas the LVAD and left ventricle generate the output jointly in patients with mild impairment, and the contribution of the left ventricle decreases with increasing LVAD speed. C_LIO_LIThe variability of the LVAD benefits with disease severity and device speeds emphasises the need for patient-specific treatment to achieve optimal therapy outcomes.

Enhanced CT is extensively used in the diagnosis of gallbladder tumors. However, false-positive results of enhanced CT can lead to misdiagnosis. As a result, patients have to bear unnecessary mental pain, expensive surgery and examination costs, surgical trauma, organ removal, loss of function, and even serious perioperative complications. False-negative enhanced CT results can lead to delayed treatment. Patients will thus have to bear the adverse consequences of negative prognosis, high treatment costs, poor quality of life, and short survival. There is an urgency to find convenient, cost-effective and noninvasive diagnostic methods to decrease the false-negative and false-positive rates of gallbladder-enhanced CT. The goal of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of YiDiXie-SS, YiDiXie-HS and YiDiXie-D in gallbladder cancer.  Patients and methodsFifty study subjects (malignant group, n=12; benign group, n=38 cases) were finally recruited in the study. Remaining serum samples from the subjects were collected and tested by applying YiDiXie  all-cancer detection kit (YiDiXie all-cancer detection kit) to assess the sensitivity and specificity of YiDiXie-SS, YiDiXie-HS and YiDiXie-D, respectively.  ResultsYiDiXie-SS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 75.8% - 100%) and a specificity of 65.8% (95% CI: 49.9% - 78.8%). YiDiXie-HS had a sensitivity of 91.7% (95% CI: 64.6% - 99.6%) and a specificity of 84.2% (95% CI: 69.6% - 92.6%). YiDiXie-D had a sensitivity of 41.7% (95% CI: 19.3% - 68.0%) and a specificity of 97.4% (95% CI: 86.5% - 99.9%). YiDiXie-SS had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 64.6% - 100%) and its specificity was 60.0% (95% CI: 31.3% - 83.2%) in patients with positive enhanced CT. This implies that the application of YiDiXie-SS decreases the false-positive rate of enhanced CT of the gallbladder by 60.0% (95% CI: 31.3% - 83.2%) with essentially no increase in the leakage of gallbladder cancer. YiDiXie-HS has a sensitivity of 80.0% (95% CI: 37.6% - 99.0%) in patients with a negative enhanced CT, and its specificity was 85.7% (95% CI: 68.5% - 94.3%). This implies that the application of YiDiXie-HS reduces the false-negative rate of enhanced CT by 80.0% (95% CI: 37.6% - 99.0%). YiDiXie  -D has a sensitivity of 28.6% (95% CI: 5.1% - 64.1%) in patients with a positive enhanced CT and a specificity of 100% (95% CI: 72.2% - 100%). This implies that YiDiXie-SS decreases the false positive rate of enhanced CT by 100% (95% CI: 72.2% - 100%).  ConclusionYiDiXie  -SS markedly decreased the rate of false-positive gallbladder-enhanced CT with basically no increase in deferred treatment of gallbladder cancer. YiDiXie  -HS significantly decreases the false-negative rate of gallbladder-enhanced CT. YiDiXie-D significantly decreases the false-positive rate of gallbladder-enhanced CT. The YiDiXie test has an excellent diagnostic value in gallbladder cancer, and expected to address the problems of ""high false-positive rate of enhanced CT"" and ""high false-negative rate of enhanced CT"" in gallbladder tumors.

Spectral unmixing of PAI data provides local myocardial characterization (e.g., oxygen saturation & tissue ablation) by overlaying unmixed PAI images with B-mode ultrasound imaging (PAI/US), with the latter providing anatomical context.

CHA2DS2-VASc is a widely used score for defining this risk, but current assessments rely on manual calculation by clinicians or approximations from structured EHR data elements. Unstructured clinical notes contain rich information that could enhance risk assessment. We developed and validated a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to extract CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors from unstructured notes in patients with AF.  MethodsWe employed a RAG architecture paired with the large language model, Llama3.1, to extract features relevant to CHA2DS2-VASc scores from unstructured notes. The model was deployed on a random set of 1,000 clinical notes (934 AF patients) from Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). To establish a gold standard, 2 clinicians manually reviewed and labeled CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors in a random subset of 200 notes. The CHA2DS2-VASc scores were calculated for each patient using structured data alone and by incorporating risk factors identified with RAG. We assessed performance across risk factors using macro-averaged area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC). For external validation, we utilized 100 manually labeled clinical notes from the MIMIC-IV database.  ResultsThe RAG model demonstrated robust performance in extracting risk factors from clinical notes. In the 1000 clinical notes, RAG identified several risk factors more frequently than structured elements, including hypertension (82.4% vs 26.2%), stroke/TIA (62.9% vs 45.5%), vascular disease (83.4% vs 56.6%), and diabetes (84.1% vs 47.2%). In the 200 expert-annotated notes, the RAG approach achieved high performance for various risk factors, with AUROCs ranging from 0.96 to 0.98 for hypertension, diabetes, and age [&ge;]75 years. Incorporating risk factors identified by RAG increased CHA2DS2-VASc scores compared with using structured data alone.  ConclusionAn LLM-optimized RAG can accurately extract CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors from unstructured clinical notes in AF patients.

The novel insights into the shared pathogenesis of PD and CAD will potentially inform future therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to identify signature genes implicated in the progression of PD to CAD.  MethodsGene expression data from NCBI GEO datasets, GSE10334 and GSE66360, associated with both PD and CAD datasets were analyzed to pinpoint differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify key modules. Functional enrichment analysis of common DEGs was conducted. Four machine learning algorithms were employed to construct predictive models, and the optimal model was selected for subsequent feature genes selection. Using GSE6751 and GSE71226 as validation cohort, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and nomograms were generated for diagnostic performance assessment and risk prediction. Furthermore, immune cell infiltration patterns were assessed using the CIBERSORT (Cell-type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts) algorithm. Finally, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of 5 clinical samples vs. 5 controls was performed to validate the identified genes and explore their potential as biomarkers for early diagnosis and prevention of comorbid periodontitis and CAD.  ResultsAnalysis of the GSE10334 and GSE66360 datasets revealed 48 common Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) associated with CAD and PD. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of these DEGs highlighted significant overrepresentation of pathways related to inflammatory responses and immune cell trafficking, including response to lipopolysaccharides, molecules of bacterial origin, neutrophil migration, bone marrow leukocyte migration, and CXCR chemokine receptor binding. Additionally, pathways involved in lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, such as the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway, were also enriched. Five genes (FOS, MME, PECAM1, RGS1, and VNN2) emerged as potential signature genes, demonstrating strong predictive ability with an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.7 on the machine learning algorithms. CIBERSORT analysis suggested a potential role of these signature genes in modulating immune cell infiltration. To further validate these findings, RNA-seq on clinical samples confirmed significant upregulation of FOS, VNN2, PECAM1, and MME genes in patients with both CAD and PD.  ConclusionThis study identified five signature genes that were significantly associated with immune cell dysregulation, where four of them were verified on clinical samples. These genes hold promise for the development of a nomogram-based approach for early diagnosis of both periodontitis and coronary artery disease, potentially informing future research directions for improved diagnosis and treatment strategies in these prevalent conditions. Notably, the prominent upregulation of FOS suggests its potential as a key target for future investigations. These insights hold significant implications for improving prevention and diagnostic strategies for individuals affected by both PD and CAD."

ResultsEight RCTs were included. aPDT with SRP showed a significant reduction in probing depth compared to doxycycline (MD = -0.55 mm, 95% CI: -1.03 to -0.07; p = 0.02). A significant difference between the two subgroups was found (p = 0.04), suggesting aPDT was more effective. No significant differences were found for HbA1c or CAL between the two interventions.  ConclusionsThe findings suggest that aPDT may offer greater benefits for the treatment of periodontitis in T2DM patients. This suggests that aPDT could potentially be a non-antibiotic alternative to doxycycline. However, as neither treatment influenced HbA1c, clinicians should not rely on periodontal therapy for glycaemic control.  Layperson summaryPeople with type 2 diabetes have a higher risk of getting gum disease because their bodies cant manage blood sugar levels well. When people with type 2 diabetes get gum disease, the swelling in their gums makes it even harder to control their blood sugar levels, making their diabetes worse. Type 2 diabetics sometimes dont respond well to regular gum treatments so dentists will also give them antibiotics to treat the gum disease. But when antibiotics are used too often, they can stop working. This is called antibiotic resistance and its a big problem in healthcare. Therefore, this study wanted to test if adding a special light therapy to regular gum treatments could replace using antibiotics. The results from this study found that the light therapy was better at healing parts of the gums compared to antibiotics. However, neither treatment made a big difference in blood sugar levels. This is important because it means that the light therapy could replace antibiotics for treating gum disease, reducing the problem of antibiotic resistance. However, more research is needed to see if these treatments could have any beneficial effect on blood sugar levels."

In recent studies2,3, psychiatric patients have shown distinct patterns in movement, posture and facial expressions, suggesting these elements could enhance clinical diagnostics.  The analysis of the facial expressions is grounded on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)4. FACS provides a systematic method for categorizing facial expressions based on specific muscle movements, enabling detailed analysis of emotional and communicative behaviors. This method combined with recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has shown promising results for the detection of the patient mental state.  We analyze video data from patients with various psychiatric symptoms, using open-source Python toolboxes for facial expression and body movement analysis. These toolboxes facilitate face detection, facial landmark detection, emotion detection and motion recognition. Specifically, we aim to explore the connection between these physical expressions and established diagnostic tools, like symptom severity scores, and finally enhance psychiatric diagnostics by integrating AI-driven analysis of video data.  By providing a more objective and detailed understanding of psychiatric symptoms, this study could lead to earlier detection and more personalized treatment approaches, ultimately improving patient outcomes. The findings will contribute to the development of innovative diagnostic tools that are both efficient and accurate, addressing a critical need in mental health care."

MethodsThis study adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We searched electronic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, for articles published up to August 1, 2024.  ResultsIn this meta-analysis, 85 eligible studies (14 on BD and 71 on MDD) were included, covering 70,856 participants: 18,738 patients and 52,118 healthy controls. Patients with mood disorders showed significant increases (p < 0.001) in the Castelli Risk Index 2 (CRI2), Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP), and (triglyceride or TG + low-density lipoprotein + very low-density lipoprotein)/(high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or HDL + Apolipoprotein A or ApoA) ratio, but not CRI1 and ApoB/ApoA ratio. Significant lower HDL and lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase activity, and higher TG levels were observed in mood disordered patients compared with controls. There were no significant differences between MDD and BD patients. Most included studies lacked the most essential information on the inclusion and exclusion of important confounders.  ConclusionsAIP is the most effective atherogenicity index for mood disorders. Regular lipid profiling and metabolic syndrome screening are crucial in mood disorders.

MDD is highly heterogeneous, with variations in symptoms, treatment response, and comorbidities that could be determined by diverse etiologic mechanisms, including genetic and neural substrates, and societal factors.  Characterizing MDD subtypes with distinct clinical manifestations could improve patient care through targeted personalized interventions. Recently, Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a promising tool for identifying homogeneous subgroups of diverse medical conditions and key disease markers, reducing complex data into comprehensible representations and capturing essential dataset features.  Our study applied TDA to data from the UK Biobank MDD subcohort composed of 3052 samples, leveraging genetic, environmental, and neuroimaging data to stratify MDD into clinically meaningful subtypes. TDA graphs were built from unimodal and multimodal feature sets and quantitatively compared based on their capability to predict depression severity, physical comorbidities, and treatment response outcomes.  Our findings showed a key role of the environment in determining the severity of depressive symptoms. Comorbid medical conditions of MDD were best predicted by brain imaging characteristics, while brain functional patterns resulted the best predictors of treatment response profiles.  Our results suggest that considering genetic, environmental, and brain characteristics is essential to characterize the heterogeneity of MDD, providing avenues for the definition of robust markers of health outcomes in MDD."

Its growing prevalence presents considerable difficulties to public health and veterinary care systems worldwide. Despite substantial research, the molecular pathways underlying OA pathogenesis remain poorly understood, limiting the development of effective treatment strategies. Exosomes, or small endosomal membrane microvesicles, have emerged as intriguing vehicles for intercellular communication and medicinal administration in a variety of illnesses, including OA. However, their efficacy and action methods in preclinical OA models require additional exploration.  MethodsWe analyzed several databases from 2016 to 2023 for original studies on exosome treatment in preclinical OA models. The inclusion criteria included studies that used exosomes generated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in both human and animal models of OA. Thematic synthesis and data extraction were used to examine research features, dosage administration techniques, and efficacy results. The quality of included studies was assessed using recognized criteria, and statistical analysis was performed to determine the efficacy of exosome treatment in decreasing Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) scores.  ResultsOur study comprised thirteen peer-reviewed articles that included both human and animal models of OA. Most trials used bone marrow MSC-derived exosomes administered intra-articularly. The analysis of OARSI scores revealed a considerable reduction in joint deterioration following exosome therapy. Source analysis demonstrated that exosome treatment originating from human and animal MSCs was consistently effective. However, an assessment of study quality revealed potential biases and limitations, emphasizing the need for more research to validate these findings and refine therapy options for OA management.

Our findings reveal that 61% of campaigns originated from states with proposed or enacted anti-transgender legislation, with 19.5% coming from states posing significant barriers to healthcare services for TGD individuals. The most common reasons for crowdfunding included housing (44.7%), living expenses (35.5%), and gender-affirming surgeries (28.1%).

Although no specific renal phenotype is identified in CF, chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in young people and adults with CF with greater frequency than in the general population. The characteristics and outcomes of kidney transplantation in the CF population have not been previously described.  MethodsWe used de-identified data supplied by the US Renal Data System (USRDS) to compare persons with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) with first kidney transplant, who did and did not have a diagnosis of CF. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics, mortality, patient survival, and death-censored graft survival using linear and logistic regression, multivariable logistic regression models, and Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests with stratification/binning by propensity scores.  ResultsOf those with dual diagnoses of CF and ESKD, half received a first kidney transplant. CF was independently associated with higher odds of receiving a living donor transplant. Those with a kidney transplant were younger than both those who did not have CF and those with CF without transplant and had higher odds of being female. Those with dual diagnoses of CF and ESKD had disproportionately lower odds of being identified as Black or African American relative to their representation in the population of all with CF and ESKD. Diabetes was more frequently a diagnosis and primary cause of ESKD in people with CF, but was approximately half as frequently the primary cause of ESKD as in those without CF. Complications of transplantation, particularly lung, were the second most frequent etiology of ESKD in people with CF. Overall survival with ESKD was 21.1 years for those with CF and 31.8 for those without CF. The survival benefit associated with transplant was 17.2 years for those with CF and 24.8 years for those without CF. Death censored median graft survival was significantly longer for those with CF, 20.4 vs 13.7 years.  ConclusionsCF is a chronic multisystem disease with features which may discourage referral and listing for kidney transplant. We used de-identified data from the USRDS datasets to describe the characteristics and outcomes of all unique individuals with the diagnosis of CF and first kidney transplant prevalent during the five-year period 2014 and 2018. Those with CF had similar odds to those without CF or receiving a first kidney transplant, and higher odds of receiving a living donor graft. Diabetes mellitus was significantly less frequently the primary cause of ESKD in those with CF and kidney transplant. Complications of solid organ transplant, particularly lung, were the second most frequent cause of ESKD in people with CF and kidney transplant. Median patient survival following the first kidney transplant was significantly shorter than for those who did not have CF, but was substantial, as was the survival advantage when compared to dialysis.

While cell free DNA (cfDNA) in blood and urine have been well studied, much less is known about the composition of cfDNA in seminal fluid. We sought to characterize cfDNA in seminal fluid through tissue of origin studies using methylation analysis in men aged 21-60 yrs. We confirmed the observations of others that seminal fluid contains an abundance of cfDNA that is both nucleosomal and >1 kb. However, here we demonstrate for the first time that the high molecular weight (HMW) DNA harbors a lower sperm signal and higher somatic cell signal compared to the nucleosomal fraction. Prostate, granulocytes and kidney showed a mean predicted increased contribution of 6.2%, 4.9% and 2.9%, respectively in the HMW fraction. While sperm was the predominant signal in most men without vasectomies, the proportion of predicted prostate contribution reached as high as 26.5% in the HMW fraction. In other subjects without vasectomies, granulocyte cfDNA made up most of the signal. We also observed subject-specific cfDNA size distribution patterns that were reproducible over time, irrespective of abstinence times. These results suggest that seminal fluid is a rich source of cfDNA from various somatic cell types, and enriching for the HMW fraction would yield even higher sensitivity for somatic cfDNA detection. Considering these novel findings, it appears that seminal fluid may be able to serve as liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of prostate cancer, benign prostate hyperplasia, prostatitis and infertility."

We aimed to (1) investigate the relationship between serum biomarkers related to oxidative stress and vasoactive substances and the occurrence of hypoperfusion and ischemic perihematomal lesions in ICH, (2) to evaluate their correlation with the volumetric evolution of the hematoma and perihematomal edema.  MethodsWe enrolled 28 patients affected by ICH. Blood samples were collected at timepoint T0 (admission to Emergency-Room), T1 (12-24hs from symptoms onset), T2 (48- 72hs from onset), to measure Endothelin-1 (ET-1), nitrites/nitrates (NO), NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX-2), metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12) and asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Patients underwent brain MRI with perfusion study at T1 and MRI without perfusion at T2.  Results12 patients had ischemic perihematomal lesions at T1. A higher NOX-2 concentration at T0 was observed in patients with ischemic perihematomal lesions compared to those without, (34.9 pg/ml vs 22.4 pg/ml, p=0.051) and with a more severe perihematomal edema at T2 (37.99 pg/ml vs. 19.17 pg/ml, p=0.011). The ischemic perihematomal lesions development was also associated with an increased hematoma volume (p<0.005), perilesional edema (p=0.046), greater midline shift (p=0.036). ET-1 values at T1 inversely correlated with hemorrhage volume at T2 ({rho}=-0.717, p=0.030).  ConclusionsNOX-2 seems to have a role in the development of ischemic perihematomal lesions. The association between higher ET-1 values and a lower hemorrhage volume could be related to the ET-1 vasoconstriction action on the ruptured vessel wall."

Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) hold significant promise for restoring communication in individuals with partial or complete loss of the ability to speak due to paralysis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, and other neurological disorders. Many of the approaches to speech decoding reported in the BCI literature have required time-aligned target representations to allow successful training - a major challenge when translating such approaches to people who have already lost their voice. Approach. In this pilot study, we made a first step toward scenarios in which no ground truth is available. We utilized a graph-based clustering approach to identify temporal segments of speech production from electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals alone. We then used the estimated speech segments to train a voice activity detection (VAD) model using only ECoG signals. We evaluated our approach using held-out open-loop recordings of a single dysarthric clinical trial participant living with ALS, and we compared the resulting performance to previous solutions trained with ground truth acoustic voice recordings. Main results. Our approach achieves a median error rate of around 0.5 seconds with respect to the actual spoken speech. Embedded into a real-time BCI, our approach is capable of providing VAD results with a latency of only 10 ms. Significance. To the best of our knowledge, our results show for the first time that speech activity can be predicted purely from unlabeled ECoG signals, a crucial step toward individuals who cannot provide this information anymore due to their neurological condition, such as patients with locked-in syndrome.

Electroacupuncture (EA) has been proved to be a feasible treatment for obesity and anxiety respectively in clinical practice. However, to date, there are no data on EAs effectiveness on anxiety for people with obesity. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EA for anxiety in people with obesity, and to observe the brain functional status of patients and the intervention effects of EA on brain function by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).  Methods and analysisThis study is a randomized, blinded, sham-controlled and clinical trial. 72 obesity patients from two hospitals with anxiety will be randomly divided into EA group and control group in 1:1 ratio by using a random number table. Patients in EA group will receive EA treatment at specific acupoints with penetrating needling for 8 weeks. The control group will receive Parks acupuncture with non- penetrating needling. Weight, waist, BMI (Body Mass Index), SAS (Self-rating Anxiety Scale), STAI (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and PSQI (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) will be performed before, after 8-week treatments and at one-month follow-up in patients. Objective metabolic parameters such as triglyceride, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, ghrelin, leptin, cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone will also be detected before and after 8-week intervention. 20 patients will be randomly selected from EA group and control group, respectively, before treatment, and 20 paired healthy participants will be recruited at the same time. The 20 patients will be scanned by fMRI before and after treatment while the other 20 healthy participants will be scanned only at baseline. Regional homogeneity, amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation and resting-state-functional-connectivity will be carried out to compare the dysfunctional brain regions between patients and healthy participants, as well as the differences between two groups of patients after treatment.

IOL aims to achieve a vaginal delivery prior to spontaneous onset of labour to prevent harm from ongoing pregnancy complications and is known to prevent stillbirths and reduce neonatal intensive care unit admissions. However, IOL doesnt come without risk and overall, 20% of mothers having an induction will still require a caesarean section birth and in primiparous mothers this rate is even higher.  There is no reliable predictive bedside tool available in clinical practice to predict which patients undergoing the IOL process will result in a vaginal birth; the fundamental aim of the IOL process. The Bishops Score (BS) remains in routine clinical practice as the examination tool to assess the cervix prior to IOL, despite it being proven to be ineffective as a predictive tool and largely subjective. This study will assess the use of the Pregnolia System, a new objective antenatal test of cervical stiffness. This study will explore its potential for pre-induction cervical assessment and indication of delivery outcome following IOL.  MethodsCASPAR is a feasibility study of term, primiparous women with singleton pregnancies undergoing IOL. Cervical stiffness will be assessed using the Pregnolia System; a novel, non-invasive, licensed, CE-marked, aspiration-based device proven to provide objective, quantitative cervical stiffness measurements represented as the Cervical Stiffness Index (CSI, in mbar). A measurement is obtained by applying the sterile single-use Pregnolia Probe directly to the anterior lip of the cervix, visualised via placement of a speculum.  Following informed consent, CASPAR study participants will undergo the Pregnolia System cervical stiffness assessment prior to their IOL process commencing. Participant questionnaires will evaluate the acceptability of this assessment tool in this population. This study will directly compare this novel antenatal test to the current BS for both patient experience of the different cervical assessment tools and for IOL outcome prediction.  DiscussionThis feasibility study will explore the use of this novel device in clinical practice for pre-induction cervical assessment and delivery outcome prediction. Our findings will provide novel data that could be instrumental in transforming clinical practice surrounding IOL. Determining recruitment rates and acceptability of this new assessment tool in this population will inform design of a further powered study using the Pregnolia System as the point-of-care, bedside cervical assessment tool within an IOL prediction model.

However, the ability to accurately classify these subtypes is limited by the technical and economic challenges faced by many centers, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In this study, we employed transcriptome sequencing to perform molecular classification of B-ALL at diagnosis in pediatric patients enrolled in the multicentric ALLIC-GATLA-2010 clinical protocol in Argentina. Using a combination of bioinformatic tools, we successfully identified single nucleotide variants, fusion transcripts and gene expression profiles, achieving molecular classification in over 90% of patients. Our analysis also revealed high-risk molecular features and novel genetic alterations. These findings hold potential clinical value for improving risk stratification and identifying therapeutic targets, particularly for patients who remain unclassified by conventional diagnostic methods."

This study presents Deep-Block, a multi-stage deep learning framework that incorporates biological knowledge into its AI architecture to identify genetic regions as significantly associated with Alzheimers disease (AD). The framework employs a three-stage approach: (1) genome segmentation based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, (2) selection of relevant LD blocks using sparse attention mechanisms, and (3) application of TabNet and Random Forest algorithms to quantify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) feature importance, thereby identifying genetic factors contributing to AD risk. The Deep-Block was applied to a large-scale whole genome sequencing (WGS) dataset from the Alzheimers Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP), comprising 7,416 non-Hispanic white participants (3,150 cognitively normal older adults (CN), 4,266 AD). First, 30,218 LD blocks were identified and then ranked based on their relevance with Alzheimers disease. Subsequently, the Deep-Block identified novel SNPs within the top 1,500 LD blocks and confirmed previously known variants, including APOE rs429358 and rs769449. The results were cross-validated against established AD-associated loci from the European Alzheimers and Dementia Biobank (EADB) and the GWAS catalog. The Deep-Block framework effectively processes large-scale high throughput sequencing data while preserving interactions between SNPs in performing the dimensionality reduction, which can potentially introduce bias or lead to information loss. The Deep-Block approach identified both known and novel genetic variation, enhancing our understanding of the genetic architecture of and demonstrating the frameworks potential for application in large-scale sequencing studies."

However, current risk stratification tools for the common, chronic diseases that develop over the lifecourse and represent the majority of disease morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs are aging and achieve only moderate predictive performance. In some common, highly morbid conditions such as mental illness no risk stratification tools are yet available. There is an urgent need to improve predictive performance for chronic diseases and understand how cumulative, multifactorial risks aggregate over time so that intervention programs can be targeted earlier and more effectively in the disease course. Chronic diseases are the end outcomes of multifactorial risks that increment over years and represent cumulative, temporally-sensitive risk pathways. However, tools in current clinical use were constructed in older data and utilize inputs from a single data collection step. Here, we present RiskPath, a multistep deep learning method for temporally-sensitive biomedical risk prediction tailored for the constraints and demands of biomedical practice that achieves very strong performance and full translational explainability. RiskPath delineates and quantifies cumulative multifactorial risk pathways and allows the user to explore performance-complexity tradeoffs and constrain models as required by clinical use cases.

We tested cross-sectional associations between radiologic measures of hypothalamic gliosis in humans and clinically relevant cardiovascular disease risk factors, as well as prevalent coronary heart disease.  MethodsUsing brain MRI images from Framingham Heart Study participants (N=867; mean age, 55 years; 55% females), T2 signal intensities were extracted bilaterally from the region of interest in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) and reference regions in the amygdala (AMY) and putamen (PUT). T2 signal ratios were created in which greater relative T2 signal intensity suggests gliosis. The primary measure compared MBH to AMY (MBH/AMY); a positive control ratio (MBH/PUT) also assessed MBH whereas a negative control (PUT/AMY) did not. Outcomes were BMI, HDL-C, LDL-C, fasting triglycerides, and the presence of hypertension (n=449), diabetes mellitus (n=66), metabolic syndrome (n=254), or coronary heart disease (n=25). Dietary risk factors for gliosis were assessed in a prospective analysis. Statistical testing was performed using linear or logistic regression.  ResultsGreater MBH/AMY T2 signal ratios were associated with higher BMI ({beta} = 21.5 [95% CI, 15.4- 27.6]; P<0.001), higher fasting triglycerides ({beta} = 1.1 [95% CI, 0.6-1.7]; P<0.001), lower HDL-C ({beta} = -20.8 [95% CI, -40.0 to -1.6]; P=0.034), and presence of hypertension (odds ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1-1.4]; P=0.0088), and the latter two were independent of BMI. Findings for diabetes mellitus were mixed and attenuated by adjusting for BMI. Metabolic syndrome was associated with MBH/AMY T2 signal ratios (odds ratio, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]; P<0.001). Model results were almost uniformly confirmed by the positive control ratios, whereas negative control ratios that did not test the MBH were unrelated to any outcomes (all P[&ge;]0.05). T2 signal ratios were not associated with prevalent coronary heart disease (all P>0.05), but confidence intervals were wide. Self-reported percentages of macronutrient intake were not consistently related to future T2 signal ratios.  ConclusionsUsing a well-established study of cardiovascular disease development, we found evidence linking hypothalamic gliosis to multiple cardiovascular disease risk factors, even independent of adiposity.

The primary outcome of our analysis was the likelihood of all-cause mortality.  ResultsOur analysis included 3 RCTs and 12 propensity-matched observational studies with a total study population of 102,794.

Metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a silent disease, of which progression to advanced disease stages including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis often goes unnoticed. As current non- invasive diagnostic tests lack specificity, the purpose of this work was to study total blood protein N-glycosylation in individuals with MASLD and various degrees of fibrosis as compared to healthy controls.  MethodsIn two independent cross-sectional cohort studies, blood N-glycosylation analysis was performed by mass spectrometry on released glycans of overall 132 MASLD patients and 99 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Relationships between glycosylation traits and the disease spectrum of MASLD including fibrotic MASLD were investigated in comparison to healthy controls. Furthermore, publicly available transcriptomics datasets were used to explore glycosyltransferase expression in patients with MASLD.  ResultsGlobally lower 2,3-sialylation distinguished MASLD from healthy controls (OR [CI]=0.36; [0.18-0.67]; p-value=0.019, and 0.11 [0.04-0.24]; p-value<0.000001), as well as non-fibrotic MASLD from its fibrotic counterparts (OR: 0.13 [0.06-0.26]; p- value<0.0001), but showed no association with steatohepatitis activity. Hepatic ST3GAL6, a sialyltransferase responsible for N-glycan 2,3-sialylation, negatively associated with fibrosis progression, similar to the observed glycomic signature. Both glycomic and transcriptomic signatures were replicated in independent cohorts.  ConclusionsFibrotic MASLD is characterized by a global decrease of blood protein 2,3-sialylation and according decrease in hepatic 2,3-sialyltransferase expression, associating with disease progression. These findings suggest alterations in the N- glycan biosynthetic pathway and are potentially useful in the early diagnosis of fibrosis in MASLD.  Lay SummaryNon-invasive markers of fibrotic MASLD perform suboptimal. This research identified that changes in blood protein glycosylation coincide with fibrosis development, offering blood-based markers that could potentially replace a liver biopsy.  What You Need to KnowO_ST_ABSBACKGROUND AND CONTEXTC_ST_ABSThe majority of the plasma glycoproteins is synthesized in the liver and changes to their glycosylation are known to affect their function and to associate with liver disorders.  NEW FINDINGSMASLD patients exhibit lower 2,3-sialylation on the complete range of their blood protein N-glycans, which coincides with the histological appearance of fibrosis, mediated likely via downregulation of hepatic ST3GAL6.  LIMITATIONSWhile the findings of this study has could have implications for diagnosing fibrotic MASLD, the identified glycomic signature needs to be confirmed in a larger, ideally prospective patient cohort.  CLINICAL RESEARCH RELEVANCEBy identifying specific signatures in the blood protein N-glycome, this research offers potential non-invasive markers for early diagnosis and monitoring of fibrosis in MASLD. Non-invasive diagnosis could potentially lessen the need for liver biopsies, and allow for timely intervention and improved disease management, ultimately leading to improvement of patient outcomes and the reduction of liver-related morbidity and mortality.  BASIC RESEARCH RELEVANCEThe observed glycomic and transcriptomic signatures offer molecular-level insights into fibrosis development in MASLD. This paves the way for future research at the intersection of glycoscience and hepatology, that will offer deeper insights into the pathophysiology of this liver disease."

It has been shown that biological differences (genetic, epigenetic, microbial, environmental, etc.) exist between patients with IBD, with multiple risk factors been associated with disease susceptibility and IBD-related phenotypes (e.g. disease location). It is also known that there is heterogeneity in terms of response to therapy in patients with IBD, including to biological therapies that target very specific biological pathways (e.g. TNF-alpha signaling, IL-23R signaling, immune cell trafficking, etc.). It is hypothesized that the better the match between the biology targeted by these advanced therapies and the predominant disease-associated pathways at play in each patient will favor a beneficial response. The aim of this pilot study was to identify potential biological differences associated with differential treatment response to the anti 4{beta}7 integrin therapy known as Vedolizumab. Our approach was to measure a broad range of analytes in the serum of patients prior to initiation of therapy and at the first clinical assessment visit, to identify potential markers of biological differences between patients at baseline and to see which biomarkers are most affected by treatment in responders. Our focus on early clinical response was to study the most proximal effects of therapy and to minimize confounders such as loss of response that occurs further distal to treatment initiation. Specifically, we performed targeted analyses of >150 proteins and metabolites, and untargeted analyses of >1100 lipid entities, in serum samples from 92 IBD patients (42 CD, 50 UC) immediately prior to initiation of therapy with vedolizumab (baseline samples) and at their first clinical assessment (14-week samples). We found lower levels of SDF-1a, but higher levels of PDGF-{beta}{beta}, lactate, lysine, phenylalanine, branched chain amino acids, alanine, short/medium chain acylcarnitines, and triglycerides containing myristic acid in baseline serum samples of responders as compared to non-responders. We also observed an increase in serum levels of CXCL9 and citrate, as well as a decrease in IL-10, between baseline and week 14 samples. In addition, we observed that a group of metabolites and protein analytes was strongly associated with both treatment response and BMI status, although BMI status was not associated with treatment response."

By 2035, it is expected that the coverage of these services will exceed 75%, making it a key model for primary care in China. However, the outcome dimensions and measurement approaches used to evaluate the effectiveness of these services remain fragmented and lack a comprehensive framework. This scoping review aims to systematically investigate the outcome dimensions and measurement approaches previously used to evaluate the effectiveness of family doctor contract services in mainland China.  MethodsThis scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the JBI methodology for scoping reviews. We will search electronic databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, PubMed, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, JBI Evidence Synthesis, PROSPERO, and Google Scholar, for literature published since 2006. Eligible sources will include policy documents, quantitative studies, and qualitative studies that assess the outcomes of family doctor contract services. Data extraction will focus on the outcome dimensions and measurement approaches used in these evaluations. Two independent reviewers will screen and extract data from the literature, and any discrepancies will be resolved through group discussions with a third reviewer. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze the extracted data, and the results will be presented through tables, charts, and a hierarchical tree diagram of outcome dimensions and measurement tools.  DiscussionThis scoping review will provide a comprehensive overview of the outcome dimensions and measurement approaches used to evaluate family doctor contract services in mainland China. It will help to identify gaps in the existing literature and offer a clearer framework for future evaluations of these services. By mapping out the outcome dimensions and tools, this review aims to contribute to improving the quality and effectiveness of family doctor contract services in China. The findings will be particularly valuable for policymakers and researchers focused on enhancing primary care systems.

MethodsUsing 2023 data from young adults in California, this study examined how social media use differed across media channels for heterosexual and LGB young adults, by gender identity. Exposure to pro-tobacco content across media channels between heterosexual and LGB young adults, by gender identity was also compared.  ResultsFindings from a representative sample of young adults in California showed that more LGB young adults reported using Tumblr and fewer reported using Facebook and Snapchat, compared with heterosexual young adults, among both males and females. Additionally, social media use differed by gender identity. For example, use of Reddit was more common among LGB versus heterosexual females, but there were no differences by sexual identity among males. Exposure to tobacco marketing was more common among LGB females compared with heterosexual females, but this was not the case for males. Exposure to user-generated e-cigarette content, and self-reported visits to e-cigarette websites, were more common among LGB females compared to heterosexual females.  ConclusionsThese findings highlight the importance of treating LGB individuals as a heterogeneous group. As such, anti-tobacco campaigns designed for LGB individuals that leverage social media will want to consider which social media platforms are most used among their target audience, ensuring maximum campaign reach."

Globally, more than 1,600 children and adolescents below the age of 19-years die every day from preventable injuries. Traffic-related injuries, falls, sports-related injuries, assaults, burns, and drownings are the most commonly reported causes of traumatic mortality among children. The mechanism of injury is always diverse in different contexts due to the differences in social determinants of health.  ObjectivesTo determine the epidemiological pattern of trauma among children 0 - 9 years in Cameroon.  MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Cameroon Trauma Registry currently running in 10 pilot sites across seven of the ten regions of Cameroon. We retrieved data for all children aged 0 - 9 years from June 2022 to August 2023. Data was analyzed with respect to the demographics, injury characteristics and outcomes.  ResultsOf the 5,439 patients captured in the trauma registry, 267 (4.9%) were children aged 0-9 years. Over 50% (152/267) of the patients were males with 35% (93/267) from rural settings. The top injury mechanism was road traffic injuries (RTI) [137(52.1%)]. These injuries occurred on the streets [142(53.4%)] during leisure activities [205(78.5%)]. Majority of children [104(39%)] involved in RTI injuries were pedestrians and no prehospital care offered to 216(82.8%) of injured children. A total of 39 (16.9%) were discharged with major disability, 111 (48.1%) had limited ability to move and 5 (2.2%) demised or succumbed to their injuries. There was a significant association between injury activity and gender (P = 0.006). Unlike the females, majority of the males were discharged with major disability [21 (53.8%)].  ConclusionThis preliminary analysis highlights the burden of trauma among children aged 0 - 9 years and its contribution to the proportion of disabled persons in Cameroon. Leisure activities on the streets increased the number of pediatric injuries especially among males. It is therefore imperative to put in place or reinforce environmental interventions to reduce the burden of pediatric injuries."

Advancements in AI algorithms, particularly deep learning techniques, show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy.  ObjectivesTo survey trends in AI research in paediatric radiology. To evaluate use cases, tasks, research methodologies and underlying data. To identify potential biases and future directions.  MethodsA systematic search of paediatric radiology AI studies published from 2015 to 2021 was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. The search included papers utilizing AI techniques for radiological diagnosis or intervention in patients aged under 18. Narrative synthesis was used due to methodological heterogeneity.  ResultsA total of 292 articles were included, with an increasing annual trend in the number of published articles. Neuroradiology and musculoskeletal radiology were the most common subspecialties. MRI was the dominant imaging modality, with segmentation and classification as the most common tasks. Retrospective cohort studies constituted the majority of research designs. Data quality and quantity varied, as did the choice of research design, data sources, and evaluation metrics.  ConclusionsAI literature in paediatric radiology shows rapid growth, with advancements in various subspecialties and tasks.

It is known that exercise training has a beneficial effect on cognition and the brain, at least in healthy people, but the impact of exercise training on cognition and the brain remains to be fully elucidated in patients with T2DM.  MethodsThis paper systematically reviews studies that evaluate the effect of exercise training on cognition in T2DM, and aims to indicate the most beneficial exercise modality for improving or preserving cognition in this patient group. In addition, the possible physiological mediators and targets involved in these improvements are narratively described in the second part of this review. Papers published up until the end of June 2024 were searched by means of the electronic database PubMed. Studies directly investigating the effect of any kind of exercise training on the brain or cognition in patients with T2DM, or animal models thereof, were included, with the exception of human studies assessing cognition only at one time point, and studies combining exercise training with other interventions (e.g. dietary changes, cognitive training, etc.).  ResultsFor the systematic part of the review, 24 papers were found to be eligible. 20 out of 24 papers (83.3%) showed a significant positive effect of exercise training on cognition in T2DM, of which four studies only showed a moderate significant effect. Four papers (16.7%) did not show a significant effect of exercise on cognition in T2DM, but two of them did show a positive trend. Similar effects were found for resistance and endurance exercise, with both possibly requiring a minimal intensity to reach cognitive improvement. In addition, BDNF, lactate, leptin, adiponectin, GSK3{beta}, GLP-1, the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway, and the PI3K/Akt pathway were identified as plausible mediators directly from studies investigating the effect of exercise training on the brain in T2DM.  ConclusionOverall, exercise training beneficially affects cognition and the brain in T2DM, with resistance and endurance exercise having similar effects. However, additional studies comparing the effect of different exercise intensities are needed to determine the optimal exercise intensity for cognitive improvement. Furthermore, we were able to define several mediators involved in the effect of exercise training on cognition in T2DM, but further research is necessary to unravel the entire process.  This review demonstrates a positive effect of exercise training on the brain in T2DM, but simultaneously emphasizes the need for additional studies on this topic. BDNF, lactate, leptin, adiponectin, GSK3{beta}, GLP-1, the AMPK/SIRT1 pathway, and the PI3K/Akt pathway were identified as factors mediating the effect of exercise on the brain in T2DM."

The risk factors, disease burden, pathology, clinical management aspects of the condition deserve to be emphasized in the medical curriculum especially in the tropical countries. In Malaysia, there are at least 18 different species of venomous land snakes among which cobra bites and Malayan pit viper bites predominate. The coverage of snake bite envenomation in medical school curriculum is inadequate judging from the poor knowledge among health care providers. PBL is an instructional mode where ""triggers"" from a problem case is used to define learning objectives. PBL enables students to understand the relevance of underlying scientific knowledge and principles in clinical practice.  MethodsWe attempted the delivery of topic of snake bite to 100 students in Year 1 module ""Body reactions to Various Agents"" using a problem-based learning (PBL) approach. The PBL case was designed; conducted according to standard format. The students were evaluated during the first and second session according to standard format. A questionnaire on the various aspects of the case, group work and facilitator was circulated and survey was based on the Likert scale. Problem based question on the same topic was used in end of block examination to assess knowledge assimilation.  Results and conclusionThe study showed a positive response in the students attitude, perception and gain of knowledge on the topic of snake bite envenomation. Problem based learning was considered an enjoyable and well-suited model for the delivery of the topic. The paucity of student friendly and medically relevant literature in textbooks and E-resources was highlighted by the students. The student score for the PBL sessions was high while the marks scored for the problem -based question showed a significant positive association between the top-scorers of the year group and the PBQ marks (p > 0.05). The PBL method is proven to improve the affective skills in the students while the cognitive skills improvement is not enhanced."

Using tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomics, we characterized peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from KTRs alongside plasma protein biomarkers and lymphocyte counts, followed by bioinformatics analyses. Our study revealed significant proteomic alterations within PBMCs of SARS-CoV-2 infected KTRs, particularly in pathways associated with glycolysis, glucose metabolism, and neutrophil degranulation. Additionally, we observed an altered immune response marked by elevated cytokines and inflammatory mediators, coupled with decreased lymphocyte counts. Notably, patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) exhibited worse outcomes, including higher rates of ICU transfer and mechanical ventilation. Comparison of PBMC proteomic profiles between AKI and non-AKI patients highlighted distinct immune-related pathways, with AKI patients showing pronounced alterations in innate immune responses, particularly in neutrophil degranulation. Moreover, our analysis unveiled a negative correlation between T cell counts and neutrophil degranulation, suggesting potential implications for immune dysregulation in COVID-19. Our findings shed light on the complex proteomic landscape and immune responses in COVID-19-infected KTRs, emphasizing the critical need for studies focused on this population, especially in individuals with AKI. Furthermore, our observations provide valuable insights for further exploration of therapeutic interventions targeting immune dysregulation pathways in this vulnerable population."

DesignWe conducted a systematic review, combining search results from two electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE) and one guideline organisation website (NICE), as well as using expert consultation and manual searching. Screening and data extraction were carried out by multiple reviewers. We collected data from each guideline on the recommendations for surveillance and the use of risk-stratification. Findings were compared between cancer types and regions. Text mining was used to extract statements commenting on the evidence for surveillance.  ResultsWe identified 123 guidelines across 16 cancer types. Almost all guidelines (n=115, 93.5%) recommend routine surveillance for recurrent disease in asymptomatic patients after initial treatment. Around half (n=59, 51.3%) recommend indefinite or lifelong surveillance. The most common modality of surveillance was cross-sectional imaging. Risk-stratification of the frequency, length, and mode of surveillance was widespread, with most of the guidelines (n=92, 74.8%) recommending that surveillance be adapted based on assessment of patient risk.

The results are then used to select the models risk threshold, offering a mechanism by which an algorithm can concretely reflect patient values.  MethodsThe entity being evaluated by AI-VOICE is an AI-informed workflow, which is composed of the patients health state, an action triggered by the AI model, and the benefits and harms accrued as a consequence of that action. The utilities of these workflows are measured through a survey-based, standard gamble experiment. These utilities define a patient-specific ratio of the cost of an inaccurate prediction versus the benefits of an accurate one.

The CFTR is expressed in all renal tubular segments. Tubular functional abnormalities as well as renal histologic changes are recognized in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurs in CF at greater frequency than in the non-CF population. The prevalence and characteristics of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the cystic fibrosis population have not previously been described.  MethodsWe used data supplied by the US Renal Data System (USRDS) to compare persons with ESKD and CF with those with ESKD who did not have a diagnosis of CF. We used linear and logistic regression, propensity score-matched Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and log-rank tests.  ResultsThe prevalence of ESKD was approximately thirty times higher than predicted in the general US population. Diabetes was more frequently a diagnosis in people with CF, but was approximately half as frequently the primary cause of ESKD than in those without CF. Complications of transplantation, particularly of lung, were rarely the cause of ESKD in those without CF but were the second most frequent etiology of ESKD in people with CF. Drugs and medications, interstitial nephritis and acute kidney injury (AKI) were more frequent primary causes in those with CF. Hypertension, cystic kidney disease, and glomerulonephritis were less frequent in those with CF. Mortality and survival with ESKD were not significantly different between those with CF and ESKD and those with ESKD who did not have CF. Diabetes mellitus and complications of lung transplantation as the primary cause of ESKD, but not lung transplant status, were associated with significantly shorter survival with ESKD in people with CF.  ConclusionsPeople living with CF have a markedly higher prevalence of ESKD than the general United States population. The profile of primary causes of ESKD differed significantly from that of the non-CF population. Diabetes mellitus was approximately half as frequently the primary cause of ESKD in those with CF. Complications of solid organ transplant, particularly lung, were the second most frequent primary cause of ESKD in people with CF. Survival with ESKD was not significantly different between those who did and did not have CF. The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and complications of lung transplantation as the primary cause of ESKD, but not lung transplant status, were associated with significantly shorter survival with ESKD in people with CF. It is our aim that these findings will promote awareness of kidney disease in persons living with CF and will encourage prevention of acute kidney injury (AKI), early detection and intervention in CKD, and preemptive referral to nephrology and transplant centers."

The current study further characterizes patients for whom this criterion persists at the 4-month Follow-Up (FU) from apparently uncomplicated AM.  MethodsTwenty-seven patients [median age 26.5, inter-quartile range: 21.9-31.9 years], underwent Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) and [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC PET at the acute phase and 4.5 [4.2-5.0] months later. Patients with > 18 cm3 MUV (FU.PET+) at the 4-month follow-up were compared to FU.PET-patients.  ResultsAt 4 months, inflammation by CMR was only identified in two patients but in 11 patients by PET (FU.PET+ group), with 5 of these 11 patients exhibiting a baseline-to-4-months expansion in MUV. Ejection Fractions (EFs) at 4 months were generally lower in FU.PET+ than FU.PET-patients (Left Ventricular (LV).EF, 52.9 [48.6; 55.0] % vs. 56.0 [54.3; 57.8] %, p=0.001). In addition, the 5 FU.PET+ patients with expansion of the MUV had a worse LV.EF evolution (4-month follow-up minus baseline difference in LV.EF: (-5.0) [(-12.9)-(-1.0)] %) vs. + 3.1 [0.94-8.0] % for the other patients, p=0.004) and the highest plasma high-sensitivity troponin-Ic at 4-months (13.0 [7.5-22.00] ng/l vs. 3.0 [2.0-9.5] ng/l, p=0.045) suggestive of a more persistent active disease. In contrast, the evolution profile of the 6-remaining FU.PET+ patients was consistent with a longer recovery time as a consequence of a more severe initial insult (i.e. with lower LV.EF and higher MUV at baseline vs. the other patients, both p < 0.05).  ConclusionsMyocardial inflammation is detected by somatostatin-PET at 4 months from an apparently uncomplicated AM in as many as 41% of patients. It is associated with a poorer recovery of cardiac function, consistent with more persistent active disease or a more severe initial insult.  Clinical PerspectiveAlthough generally of mild severity, myocarditis may potentially involve dreaded complications such as heart failure, arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. We recently showed that the Somatostatin-positron emission tomography (PET) determination of inflammatory cell volume constitutes an alternative to cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for detecting myocarditis at the acute phase. The present study shows that PET criteria of myocardial inflammation persist at four months from apparently uncomplicated myocarditis at a much higher rate than CMR (41% vs. 7% of patients). Moreover, this persistence is associated with a poorer recovery of cardiac function and is in line with two different evolution profiles--i.e., a more persistent active disease or a more severe initial insult. These new findings have the potential to improve monitoring and treatment adaptations for myocarditis patients.

Concomitant severe mitral regurgitation (MR) contributes to the low flow state, adding complexity to diagnosis and management. This study aimed to examine the impact of severe MR on outcomes in paradoxical LFLGAS.  MethodsData from an institutional echo database identified 1,189 patients with adjudicated severe aortic stenosis (AVA[&le;]1.0 cm2), low transaortic gradients (mean gradient<40 mmHg), preserved LVEF ([&ge;]50%), and low flow rate (Q[&le;]210 ml/sec), to confirm paradoxical LFLGAS. Subgroups were based on MR severity (severe and non-severe). Clinical outcomes included all-cause mortality, aortic valve replacement (AVR), heart failure hospitalizations, and a composite outcome.  ResultsIn the severe MR group (n=80), patients had lower flow rates, increased LV dimensions and a more eccentric hypertrophy pattern compared to non-severe MR (n=1,109). Over a median 5-year follow-up, severe MR correlated with higher all-cause mortality (p=0.02) and AVR rates (p=0.012). After adjustment, severe MR was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality risk (HR=1.43, p=0.011) and composite outcome (HR=1.64, p<0.001). AVR significantly reduced mortality at every MR degree, with the most substantial impact in severe MR (HR=0.18, p<0.001). Propensity-adjusted models demonstrated a stronger AVR impact with increasing MR degree (p-for-interaction=0.044).  ConclusionsSevere MR in paradoxical LFLGAS is associated with adverse outcomes and distinctive LV remodeling. Aortic valve replacement improves survival across all MR grades, with greater impact in severe MR."

Current diagnostic methods are often invasive, time-consuming, or costly. This study explores the use of proteome-wide autoantibody screening (PWAS) for noninvasive dementia diagnosis by analyzing serum samples from Alzheimers disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and age-matched cognitively normal individuals (CNIs). Serum samples from 35 subjects were analyzed utilizing our original wet protein arrays that covers approximately 90% of human transcriptome, revealing elevated gross autoantibody levels in AD and DLB patients compared to CNIs. A total of 229 autoantibodies were differentially elevated in AD and/or DLB, effectively distinguishing between patient groups. Machine learning models showed high accuracy in classifying AD, DLB, and CNIs. Gene ontology analysis highlighted autoantibodies targeting neuroactive ligands/receptors in AD and lipid metabolism proteins in DLB. Notably, autoantibodies targeting neuropeptide B (NPB) and adhesion G protein-coupled receptor F5 (ADGRF5) showed significant correlations with clinical traits including Mini Mental State Examination scores, suggesting a role in dementia pathogenesis. The study demonstrates the potential of PWAS and AI integration as a noninvasive diagnostic tool for dementia, uncovering biomarkers that could enhance understanding of disease mechanisms. Limitations include demographic differences, small sample size, and lack of external validation. Future research should involve longitudinal observation in larger, diverse cohorts and functional studies to clarify autoantibodies roles in dementia pathogenesis and their diagnostic and therapeutic potential."

Genetic studies have identified numerous associated loci, many potentially encoding plasma proteins. However, the causal effects of plasma proteins on AAA have not been thoroughly studied. We used genetic causal inference approaches to identify plasma proteins that have a potential causal impact on AAA.  MethodsCausal inference was performed using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). For AAA, we utilized recently published summary statistics from a multi-population genome-wide association (GWAS) meta-analysis including 39,221 individuals with, and 1,086,107 individuals without AAA from 14 cohorts. We used protein quantitative trait loci (pQTLs) identified in two large-scale plasma-proteomics studies (deCODE and UKB-PPP) to generate genetic instruments. We tested 2,783 plasma proteins for possible causal effects on AAA using two-sample MR with inverse variance weighting and common sensitivity analyses to evaluate the MR assumptions. Bayesian colocalization and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analyses provided additional insights.  ResultsMR identified 90 plasma proteins associated with AAA at FDR<0.05, with 25 supported by colocalization analysis. Among those supported by both MR and colocalization were previously experimentally validated proteins such as PCSK9 (OR 1.3; 95%CI 1.2-1.4; P<1e-10), LTBP4 (OR 3.4; 95%CI 2.6-4.6; P<1e-10) and COL6A3 (OR 0.6; 95%CI 0.5-0.7; P<1e-6). GO analysis revealed enrichment of proteins found in extracellular matrix (ECM, OR 7.8; P<1e-4), some with maximal mRNA levels in aortic tissue. Bi-directional MR suggested plasma level changes were not caused by liability to AAA itself. We then investigated whether variants responsible for expression changes in the aorta also influenced plasma levels and AAA risk. Colocalization analysis showed that an aortic expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for COL6A3, and a splicing quantitative trait locus (sQTL) for LTBP4 colocalized with their respective plasma pQTLs and AAA signals (posterior probabilities 0.84 and 0.89, respectively).  ConclusionsOur results highlight proteins and pathways with potential causal effects on AAA, providing a foundation for future functional experiments. These findings suggest a possible causal pathway whereby genetic variation affecting ECM proteins expressed in the aortic wall cause their levels to change in blood plasma, influencing development of AAA."

The primary outcome was composite placental pathology that included high grade maternal vascular malperfusion or greater than 25 percent perivillous fibrin deposition. There were 63 patients who had the composite placental pathology outcome. In adjusted analyses that controlled for maternal age, parity, active infection at delivery, interval from time of diagnosis to delivery and COVID-19 variant, timing of COVID-19 during pregnancy was not associated with risk of the composite placental pathology outcome. Among secondary COVID-19 related exposures we investigated, severity of disease and treatment for COVID-19 were associated with risk of the composite placental pathology outcome.

Previous investigations of AUD heterogeneity using molecular genetics methods studied the association between genetic liability and individual AUD symptoms at the latent level or focusing on a small number of genetic variants. Notably, these studies did not investigate potential severity differences between symptoms in their genetic analyses. Therefore, the current study aimed to examine the genetic risk for individual AUD symptom criteria by using a polygenic risk score (PRS) approach to assess the relative severity of each AUD symptom and test for associates with AUD symptoms above and beyond a unidimensional AUD construct. An AUD PRS was created using summary statistics obtained from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models were employed to examine the effect of the PRS on overall AUD severity as well as on individual symptoms after accounting for this overall effect. The phenotypic severity of AUD symptoms was highly correlated with the genetic severity of AUD symptoms (r = 0.78). Results of MIMIC models indicated that the AUD PRS significantly predicted the AUD factor. Regression paths testing the unique, direct effects of the PRS on individual AUD symptoms, independent of the latent AUD factor, were not significant. These results imply that PRSs derived from GWAS of AUD influence symptom expression through a single genetic factor that is highly correlated with the relative severity of individual symptoms when measured at the phenotypic level. Item-level GWAS of AUD symptoms are needed to further parse heterogeneous symptom expression and allow for more nuanced tests of these conclusions."

MethodsWe conducted difference-in-differences analysis on CDC WONDER data before and after McDonald v. Chicago, the landmark 2010 Supreme Court decision on firearms regulation. States were divided into three groups, based on legal actions taken before and since 2010, most permissive, permissive, and restricted. Firearm mortality trends before (1999-2010) and after (2010-2023) were determined and compared across the three groups for all intents and by intent (homicide and suicide). Within the most permissive state grouping, pediatric firearm mortality by 2013 urbanicity and by observed race and ethnicity were conducted. For each US state, pre-and- post 2010 all-intent pediatric firearm mortality incident rates were compared.  ResultsThere were 7130 excess pediatric firearms deaths in states with more permissive regulatory regimes than those with stricter frameworks, as well as higher rates of homicide and suicide. Non-Hispanic Black populations were disproportionately affected by these trends. Four states (California, Maryland, New York, and Rhode Island) had decreased pediatric firearm mortality after 2010, all of which were in the restrictive firearms law group.  ConclusionStates with more permissive firearm laws have experienced greater pediatric firearm mortality during the post-McDonald v. Chicago era.  KEY POINTS  QuestionDid states enacting permissive firearm laws after 2010--when McDonald v. Chicago was decided by the United States Supreme Court--subsequently experience higher rates of pediatric firearm mortality?  FindingsDifference-in-difference analysis found that state groups that enacted more permissive firearm laws after 2010 experienced >7,100 firearm deaths in children and adolescents ages 0-17 between 2010-2023 compared to restrictive law-enacting states, of which most (77.5%) were homicides. In the permissive states groups, increases occurred in all urbanicities. The largest increase occurred in non-Hispanic Black children and adolescents. Four states had statistical decreases in pediatric firearm mortality during the study period, all of which were in states which enacted restrictive firearm policies.

In radiology, studies have demonstrated the strong performance of LLMs in diagnostic imaging quiz cases. However, the inherent differences of prior probabilities of a final diagnosis between clinical and quiz cases pose challenges for LLMs, as LLMs had not been informed about the quiz nature in previous literature, while human physicians can optimize the diagnosis, consciously or unconsciously, depending on the situation. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that notifying LLMs about the quiz nature might improve diagnostic accuracy.  MethodsOne-hundred-and-fifty consecutive cases from the ""Case of the Week"" radiological diagnostic quiz case series on the American Journal of Neuroradiology website were analyzed. GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet were used to generate top three differential diagnoses based on the textual clinical history and figure legends. The prompts included or excluded information about the quiz nature for both models. Two radiologists evaluated the accuracy of the diagnoses. McNemars test assessed differences in correct response rates.  ResultsInforming the quiz nature improved the diagnostic performance of both models. Specifically, Claude 3.5 Sonnets primary diagnosis and GPT-4os top 3 differential diagnoses significantly improved when the quiz nature was informed.  ConclusionInforming the quiz nature of cases significantly enhances LLMs diagnostic performances. This insight into LLMs capabilities could inform future research and applications, highlighting the importance of context in optimizing LLM-based diagnostics."

PurposeTo create a systematic framework for evaluating the performance of segmentation models using clinically relevant criteria.  Materials and MethodsWe developed the AUGMENT framework (Assessing Utility of seGMENtation Tools), based on a structured classification of main categories of error in segmentation tasks. To evaluate the framework, we assembled a team of 20 clinicians covering a broad range of radiological expertise and analysed the challenging task of segmenting metastatic ovarian cancer using AI. We used three evaluation methods: (i) Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), (ii) visual Turing test, assessing 429 segmented disease-sites on 80 CT scans from the Cancer Imaging Atlas), and (iii) AUGMENT framework, where 3 radiologists and the AI-model created segmentations of 784 separate disease sites on 27 CT scans from a multi-institution dataset.  ResultsThe AI model had modest technical performance (DSC=72{+/-}19 for the pelvic and ovarian disease, and 64{+/-}24 for omental disease), and it failed the visual Turing test. However, the AUGMENT framework revealed that (i) the AI model produced segmentations of the same quality as radiologists (p=.46), and (ii) it enabled radiologists to produce human+AI collaborative segmentations of significantly higher quality (p=<.001) and in significantly less time (p=<.001).  ConclusionQuantitative performance metrics of segmentation algorithms can mask their clinical utility. The AUGMENT framework enables the systematic identification of clinically usable AI-models and highlights the importance of assessing the interaction between AI tools and radiologists.  Summary statementOur framework, called AUGMENT, provides an objective assessment of the clinical utility of segmentation algorithms based on well-established error categories.  Key resultsO_LICombining quantitative metrics with qualitative information on performance from domain experts whose work is impacted by an algorithms use is a more accurate, transparent and trustworthy way of appraising an algorithm than using quantitative metrics alone. C_LIO_LIThe AUGMENT framework captures clinical utility in terms of segmentation quality and human+AI complementarity even in algorithms with modest technical segmentation performance.

However, there are no studies supporting the premise that individuals with more severe stenosis respond poorly to conservative management. The purpose of this study was to compare improvements in pain, disability, strength, medication usage, and patient goals in response to an exercise-based physical therapy program across 1,806 individuals with mild, moderate, or severe lumbar spine stenosis. Participants demonstrated significant improvements in all variables of interest (p<0.001), and 11.5% of participants reported cessation of narcotic use with treatment. There were no significant differences in treatment response across mild, moderate, or severe stenosis groups for any outcome (p>0.546). Exercise-based rehabilitation is as beneficial in the short term for individuals presenting for nonoperative care with severe stenosis compared to their milder counterparts.

Physical therapy (PT) effectively complements pharmacological treatment to improve postural stability, gait performance, and other dopamine-resistant symptoms (e.g. festination, hesitation, axial motor dysfunctions, and FOG) in PwPD who are non-surgically treated. Despite the potential for positive adjuvant effects of PT following STN-DBS surgery, there is a paucity of science available on the topic. In such a scenario, gathering the opinion and expertise of leading investigators worldwide was pursued to study motor rehabilitation in PwPD following STN-DBS. After summarizing the few available findings through a systematic review, we identified clinical and academically experienced DBS clinicians (n=21) to discuss the challenges related to PT following STN-DBS. A 5-point Likert scale questionnaire was used and based on the results of the systematic review along with a Delphi method. Thirty-nine questions were submitted to the panel - half related to general considerations on PT following STN-DBS, half related to PT treatments. Despite the low-to-moderate quality, the few available rehabilitative studies suggested that PT could improve dynamic and static balance, gait performance and posture. Similarly, panellists strongly agreed that PT might help in improving motor symptoms and quality of life, and it may be possibly prescribed to maximize the effects of the stimulation. The experts agreed that physical therapists could be part of the multidisciplinary team taking care of the patients. Also, they agreed on prescribing of conventional PT, but not massage or manual therapy. Our results will inform the rehabilitation and the DBS community to engage, publish and deepen this area of research. Such efforts may spark guidelines for PT following STN-DBS.

Dance-based movement therapy has been studied as an adjuvant treatment for PD symptoms by modulating some inflammatory interleukins and improving the overall effect of pharmacological treatments.  ObjectiveTo evaluate the levels of Interleukin 4, Interleukin 1, cortisol hormone, and blood cell total numbers in PD subjects undergoing dance-based movement therapy.  MethodsTwenty-five participants were selected for this study. Seventeen subjects diagnosed with PD were divided into two groups: PD group (n=8) and PD+dance group (n=9). Another group was composed of age-matched healthy controls (n=8). The dance-based movement therapy was performed twice a week for 50-60 minutes/session over six months.  ResultsThe serum IL-4 levels were significantly lower in the PD group when compared to the healthy group, while the PD+Dance group showed similar levels to the healthy group. The levels of IL-1, cortisol, and blood cell count showed no statistical differences between groups.  ConclusionOur results suggest that regular practice of dance-based movement therapy may induce a neuroprotective effect by modulating the levels of IL-4 in people with PD similarly to healthy participants.

Although an EEG shows advantages in availability and cost compared to the current diagnostic tools, it is not routinely used in clinical practice. Previous reviews have either focused on single disease populations and/or solely on resting state EEG. To evaluate the utility of EEG for early diagnosis and differential diagnosis, we conducted a systematic review across Alzheimers disease (AD), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) and Lewy Body Dementia (DLB).  MethodsWe searched databases Pubmed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus for articles published from 2000 to 2023 investigating resting-state and task-based EEG-markers in biomarker-proven AD, FTD and DLB.  ResultsOur search yielded a total of 12010 studies, of which 71 papers were eligible: 34 on AD, 18 on DLB and 9 on FTD. Slowing of the frequency spectrum was a common observation across diseases, achieving excellent sensitivity in AD and DLB. Research on FTD was limited and with varying results in the discrimination from healthy controls, although connectivity analysis and microstates are promising avenues. In differential diagnosis, both spectral and connectivity metrics show encouraging results. Task-based EEG emerges as a promising tool in early AD.  ConclusionEEG shows promise as a cost-effective, non-invasive tool for early detection and differential diagnosis. Future research should aim to collect standardized data from multicentric cohorts, across multiple diseases and stages, and explore the neural underpinnings of these diseases, to improve interpretability of the findings."

Thiamine deficiency, a well-known feature of AD, may contribute to these alterations.  MethodsThe expressions of four known genes associated with thiamine metabolism were studied in brain samples from patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. The results were further demonstrated in AD and diabetic mouse and cellular models. The phenotypes of mice with conditional Thiamine pyrophosphokinase-1 (Tpk) knockout in brain excitatory neurons were investigated. The therapeutic effects of thiamine diphosphate supplement and Tpk delivery on cellular and mouse models were explored. Phase 2 clinical trial of benfotiamine, a thiamine derivative, plus donepezil was performed.  ResultsOnly TPK expression was inhibited in brain samples of AD patients, while none of thiamine-associated genes were significantly changed in other neurodegenerative disorders. TPK inhibition in the brains and neurons was verified in AD and diabetic mouse and cellular models. Mice with Tpk deletion in neurons exhibited all major pathophysiological alterations of AD, including amyloid deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and brain atrophy. TPK expression restoration and thiamine diphosphate supplement ameliorated the pathophysiological and behavioral phenotypes in mouse and cell models with Tpk insufficiency. Benfotiamine delayed cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients with a dose-effect relationship, particularly with a significant attenuation of the deterioration in moderate AD patients by post hoc analysis.  ConclusionsTPK deficiency and hence thiamine diphosphate reduction in neurons are a decisive factor driving multiple pathophysiologic alterations of AD, unveiling a new direction for the disease mechanism and treatment."

In the present study, a cohort of moderate-late preterm infants born between 32 and 34 weeks gestational age was analyzed to determine whether CP disease severity, comorbid conditions, and genetic testing are associated with particular MRI findings. We identified that comorbid conditions and CP severity are similar across imaging patterns regardless of the perceived severity of the imaging findings. Genetic diagnoses were identified in 13% of all patients. In patients with MRI concerning for injuries, over 20% had genetic testing sent. Abnormal MRI findings in moderate-late preterm infants with CP are common, but are not a strong predictor of disease severity and may be associated with underlying genetic causes that are underdiagnosed due to unclear practice guidelines."

However, the success of this procedure heavily relies on precise acetabular cup positioning, which is insufficient using traditional placement guidelines. This insufficiency is evidenced by the persistent occurrence of dislocations, highlighting the critical need for enhanced pelvic alignment accuracy. Standard surgical tables present challenges in maintaining consistent pelvic positioning during the procedure, making it difficult to achieve optimal alignment.  PurposeThis study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a traction surgical table in stabilizing pelvic movements during total hip arthroplasty and compare it with the use of a standard surgical table.  MethodsThis retrospective study assessed 88 total hip arthroplasties performed using the AR-HIP (Zimmer Biomet Japan, Tokyo, Japan) system for real-time pelvic navigation. Procedures were performed using either a standard surgical table (n=48) or a traction surgical table (n=40). Pelvic alignment was monitored at multiple surgical stages, and stability was statistically analyzed to compare the efficacy of the two table types.  ResultsThe traction table significantly stabilized anteroposterior pelvic movements across all critical surgical stages (p<0.05), except during anterior capsular release. In contrast, procedures performed on the standard table exhibited less stability in anteroposterior pelvic movements, suggesting the superior performance of the traction table.  ConclusionsCompared with the standard table, the use of the traction table in total hip arthroplasty effectively controls anteroposterior pelvic movements and improves acetabular cup alignment. However, lateral pelvic stability remains uncontrolled using both table types, indicating a need for further technological advancements in surgical practice to improve the outcomes of total hip arthroplasty."

Longer-term survival and reintervention rates are not well defined.  MethodsRetrospective analysis of patients undergoing transseptal MViV with SAPIEN 3 valve family for failed surgical bioprostheses from June 2015 to March 2024 in the Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data linkage was performed. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, and reintervention. Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazards analysis of outcomes was performed according to Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score and procedure status.  Results5,971 patients (72.9 {+/-} 11.4 years, 57.9% female) underwent MViV. Low (<4), intermediate (4-8), and high (>8) STS scores were present in 1310 (23.5%), 1960 (35.1%) and 2315 (41.5%) patients, respectively. 30-day mortality occurred in 0.9% of patients with low STS scores; 2.7%, intermediate; and 7.0%, high (p<0.001). Predicted mortality at 3 years was proportional to STS score at 15.8%, 23.3%, and 44.5% (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Stroke rates at 3 years were comparable except between low and high STS groups (7.6% vs. 11.4%, p=0.002). Mitral valve reintervention during 3 years of follow-up was similarly uncommon in all groups at 3.8, 3.0, and 2.8% (p=0.71), respectively. Elective procedures were associated with lower 3-year mortality compared to non-elective procedures (HR 0.51, [95% CI: 0.45, 0.58], p<0.001). Strongest predictors of 3-year mortality included current hemodialysis, cardiogenic shock on presentation, and immunocompromised state.  ConclusionThree-year survival after MViV is favorable in low and intermediate STS scores and elective procedures, whereas survival was significantly lower in high STS scores and non-elective procedures. These findings emphasize the importance of early identification and treatment of patients who may benefit from MViV. Reintervention rates at 3 years are low regardless of STS score.

Lurie Children’s Hospital of Chicago, McGraw Medical Center , Chicago, IL']","Preterm infants are at high risk for systemic inflammatory disorders, including sepsis, meningitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). The developing brain of the premature newborn is especially susceptible to the cascade of inflammatory mediators elaborated in these conditions that cross the blood-brain barrier. NEC, a severe and potentially fatal condition of the gut that occurs in premature newborns, is a prime example of how an inflammatory reaction, perhaps initially localized, can become generalized and cause systemic harm. One such result is brain injury, especially to the cerebral white matter, which may lead to neurodevelopmental abnormality and dysregulated behavior. Numerous studies have documented an association between necrotizing enterocolitis and neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI), but to date, the brain and behavioral deficits associated with neonatal NEC are not fully understood. We performed a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of existing literature to characterize brain injury and behavioral alterations associated with NEC. 7153 peer-reviewed published manuscripts were screened by two independent reviewers and evidence quality was assessed using GRADE criteria. Of these papers, 62 satisfied the criteria for our review (i.e., no case reports, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, or animal studies). Data from 32 papers using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development to assess infant outcomes were included in the meta-analysis. Our findings support neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis having deleterious effects on brain and behavioral development and impact on cognitive function, risk of cerebral palsy and motor impairment, educational achievement, behavior, and neuroanatomy. We discuss herein findings of both short-term outcomes (1-3 years) and long-term outcomes (until 13 years). Our meta-analysis also indicates that NEC has a moderate effect size on infant development, with consistent impairment across mental, cognitive, language and motor domains.  WHAT DO THE FINDINGS OF THIS REVIEW MEAN?In this review, we describe several short-term and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants with NEC. These findings suggest that infants with NEC should be monitored with close developmental follow-up so that individuals can receive appropriate testing that may prompt therapies and qualify them to receive early intervention services.  HOW UP TO DATE IS THIS REVIEW?The review authors searched for studies published up to 2021. Abstracts with no data available were excluded, so this review does not consider any new findings published from 2022-2024."

The diagnostic process for ADHD is often time-consuming and subjective in nature. Recent advancements in machine learning offer promising avenues for improving ADHD diagnosis automatically using various data sources. In this study, we harness Fitbit-derived physical activity measurements to investigate potential associations with ADHD and evaluate machine learning classifiers for their predictive accuracy in ADHD diagnosis. Our analysis involves a sample of 450 participants from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study data release 5.0. We conduct correlation analyses to explore the connections between ADHD diagnosis and Fitbit-derived measurements, including sedentary time, resting heart rate, and energy expenditure. Subsequently, we employ multivariable logistic regression models to assess the predictive capability of these measurements for ADHD diagnosis. Furthermore, we train machine learning classifiers to achieve a diagnosis by automatically categorizing individuals into ADHD+ and ADHD-groups. Our correlation analysis unveils statistically significant associations between ADHD diagnosis and Fitbit-derived measurements, suggesting a potential link between physical activity patterns and ADHD. Importantly, multivariable logistic regression models demonstrate that some of the Fitbit measurements significantly predict ADHD diagnosis. Notably, our Random Forest machine learning classifier outperforms other classifiers with cross-validation accuracy (0.89), AUC (0.95), precision (0.88), recall (0.90), f1-score (0.89) and test accuracy (0.88), surpassing the performance of previous ADHD classification studies. These findings not only lay the groundwork for further exploration but also offer insights into the clinical integration of wearable data for a deeper understanding and improved identification of ADHD."

For validation, we performed deep, targeted sequencing of CHIP-causing genes in an established clinical cohort of 132 RA cases, 56 controls, and 544 external controls. We compared the rates of CHIP between cases and controls using logistic linear regression.  ResultsIn the UKBiobank and in meta-analysis, the presence of a large CHIP clone was associated with an increased risk for SPRA (HR = 2.57 with CI [1.46, 4.52] and p = 0.001) and RA (HR = 1.43 with CI [1.16, 1.75] and p = 7 x 10-4). Medium CHIP clones were associated with smaller increases in risk for SPRA and RA, and small CHIP clones carried no increased risk of any outcome. There were no associations detected between SNRA and CHIP of any size. In the clinical RA cohort, cases were more likely to have CHIP than controls after correcting for age, age2, and sex (OR: 2.08, HR [1.09, 3.83], p = 0.02).  ConclusionIn a meta-analysis combing data from three large biobanks, large CHIP clones were associated with an increased risk for incident SPRA and, to a lesser extent, increased risk for RA. Validating this biobank-based finding, in a well-phenotyped clinical cohort, cases had higher rates of CHIP than age-matched controls. The mechanism by which CHIP drives the increased risk for SPRA is not known, but if it were discovered, could inform early intervention for patients with CHIP to prevent RA or personalized therapy for patients with RA based on CHIP status."

DesignA cross-sectional qualitative interview study was conducted with women [&ge;]18-years-old who identified as Asian American and had a diagnosis of infertility. Semi-structured interviews were performed until thematic saturation was reached. The interviews were transcribed and coded. A codebook was developed to capture the grounded perspectives of participants. The web application Dedoose was utilized to conduct content analysis, identifying common themes and patterns.  ResultsAsian Americans voice the importance of having children, emphasizing the cultural expectation to procreate. They reported that infertility caused immense mental and emotional distress, resulting in feelings of disappointment and grief. Participants noted that it is not common in their culture to talk about infertility-related issues. Religion and naturopathic remedies played a large role in helping participants adjust to their infertility journeys. Participants stated that the infertility evaluation was complicated and one particular area of frustration was the lack of individually centered treatment. Interestingly, participants expressed desire to help other Asian women who are also struggling with infertility.  ConclusionInfertility is a difficult and complex experience for Asian American women. Parenthood is a strong expectation for people of Asian descent and results in emotional burden when complicated by infertility. Fertility concerns are considered taboo to openly discuss, which can cause additional feelings of isolation. Healthcare providers should work to address the culturally induced shame associated with infertility and provide more individualized care."

While APOE4 is strongly associated with amyloid-beta (A{beta}) accumulation, its relationship with tau accumulation is less understood. Studies evaluating the role of APOE4 on tau accumulation have shown conflicting results, particularly regarding the independence of these associations from A{beta} load. To clarify the relations between APOE4, A{beta} and tau, we examined three independent longitudinal cohorts (the Swedish BioFINDER-1, BioFINDER-2 and WRAP cohorts) in which participants had cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of tau tangles (tau-PET; temporal meta-ROI and entorhinal) or soluble p-tau (p-tau217), A{beta}-PET and APOE genotype. The study included a total of 1370 cognitively unimpaired (CU) and 449 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, followed longitudinally with tau-PET and p-tau217. APOE4 carriers accounted for 40.2-50% of the cohorts. Different linear regressions (cross-sectional) and linear mixed-effect models (longitudinal) with tau measures as outcomes were fitted to test the effect of APOE4 as independent predictor, as well as in combination with baseline A{beta} load or the interaction term between APOE4 and A{beta} load. All models included age, sex and cognitive status as covariates.  We found no independent effects of the APOE4 carriership on insoluble tau aggregates in either cohort (BioFINDER-2 or WRAP), both on cross-sectional and longitudinal tau-PET levels in the temporal meta-ROI, when A{beta} was present in the model (p=0.531-0.949). A{beta} alone was the best predictor of insoluble tau accumulation, and there was no interaction between APOE4 and A{beta} on tau-PET. Similarly, no independent effects of the APOE4 carriership on baseline (p=0.683-0.708) and longitudinal (p=0.188-0.570) soluble p-tau217 were observed when A{beta} was included in the model in BioFINDER-1 and WRAP. No interaction between APOE4 and A{beta} on soluble p-tau217 was observed. Furthermore, mediation analysis revealed that A{beta} load fully mediated most associations between APOE4 and tau (46-112%, either cross-sectional or longitudinal tau-PET or soluble p-tau217). In the largest cohort (BioFINDER-2), looking at APOE4 groups based on the number of {varepsilon}4 alleles, we found an interaction between APOE4 homozygotes only and A{beta} on tau-PET levels at baseline and over time.  In conclusion, although APOE4 is strongly associated with A{beta} aggregation, it seems to be minimally associated with longitudinal changes in soluble or insoluble p-tau levels at a given level of A{beta} pathology, confirming the primacy of A{beta} in driving tau pathology."

However, patient screening for clinical trials is complex and resource intensive. There is a need to increase the scalability of trial recruitment while maintaining or improving upon the sensitivity of the current process. We hypothesized that we could use a state-of-the-art large language model, prompt engineering, and publicly available clinical trial data to predict patient eligibility for clinical trials from clinic notes. Here, we present pilot data demonstrating the accuracy of our tool in a cohort of patients being evaluated for pancreas cancer.  MethodsWe used a cohort of patients who were screened for clinical trials at a single institution for this study. We developed an LLM application using LangChain and the GPT-4o model to assist in clinical trial screening. Deidentified patient data from clinical notes and trial eligibility criteria from ClinicalTrials.gov were used as inputs. For each patient and trial, the model determined inclusion or exclusion with selected eligibility criteria as well as the trial overall. Model responses were graded programmatically against a human rater standard. We recorded time elapsed and cost of running each analysis.  ResultsOf the 24 patients in the test set, 19 were eligible for at least one trial. There were 43 eligible patient-trial matches in our data set. Our model correctly predicted 39 out of 42 (90.7%) of these matches. There were 105 individual eligibility criteria evaluated per patient for a total of 2520 binary criteria. GPT-4o agreed with the raters for 2438 out of 2520 (96.7%) binary eligibility criteria.  Sensitivity to overall trial eligibility by trial ranged from 87.5% to 100% for 8 out of 9 trials. The application incorrectly screened the single patient in the CA-4948 trial test set, leading to a sensitivity of 0% for this trial. Specificity ranged from 73.3% to 100% over all nine trials. The median cost for screening a patient was 0.67 USD (0.63-0.74). Median time elapsed was 137.66 seconds (130.04-146.04). Median total token usage across three assistants was 112,266.5 tokens (102982.0-122174.2).  ConclusionOverall, our model showed high efficiency and accuracy in selecting patients for appropriate clinical trials. Our results showed promise with a small cohort and future studies are needed to assess its accuracy with a larger sample of patients and trials. This model can be applied systematically to widen the surface area covered by the screening process as well as adapted to any set of clinical trials, opening the door for expansion to other surgical and medical disciplines."

High blood glucose and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels have also been linked to neurodegeneration and AD. However, there is limited understanding of the relationships between dementia-related risk factors in the brain and blood.  MethodsA linear mixed model was used to examine the relationship between blood glucose and HDL-C levels and the progression of brain hypometabolism, adjusting for APOE4 and other clinical covariates. The hypometabolic convergence index (HCI) was measured by fluorodeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in participants from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Data visualizations were generated to understand the joint effects of plasma glucose, HDL-C, and APOE4 on HCI.  ResultsThere were 336 individuals (781 observations), of whom 22.62% had AD. The majority were male (63.98%) and of white race, and 48.51% were carriers of APOE4. Over time, high blood glucose level was associated with the progression of brain glucose hypometabolism ({beta}=0.33, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.64, p<0.05). A high plasma HDL-C level ({beta}=1.22, 95% CI: 0.09, 2.35, p<0.05), more study visits ({beta}=1.67, 95% CI: 1.37, 1.98, p<0.001), and being an APOE4 allele carrier ({beta}=1.29, 95% CI: 0.15, 2.42, p<0.05) were also significant predictors of brain hypometabolism progression. APOE4 carrier status and number of visits account for the largest proportion of the variance from the fixed effects model. Random effects due to participant characteristics and fixed effects together accounted for 95.2% of the model variance. Subgroup analysis revealed that these effects were observed only in those without AD.  ConclusionHigh plasma glucose levels facilitated the progression of brain hypometabolism. The effect was more prominent in the APOE4 double-carriers with elevated HDL-C. Elevated blood glucose may reflect systemic insulin resistance, which could impair brain glucose uptake, resulting in brain hypometabolism. Controlling blood glucose and HDL-C levels in APOE4 carriers may improve brain metabolism, potentially delaying the onset of dementia."

Methods40,839 participants from the Mayo Clinic Bipolar Disorder Biobank (BD Biobank; n=774) and Mayo Clinic Biobank (n=485 BD cases, n=39,580 controls) were included in the phecode analyses [insomnia, SUD, alcohol use disorder (AUD) and tobacco use disorder (TUD)]. 1789 cases were included in analyses of the BD Biobank questionnaire data, which included information on BD subtype and various SUDs. Logistic regression was used to test for associations between insomnia polygenic risk scores (PRS) and insomnia and SUD phenotypes in BD cases and controls.  ResultsInsomnia PRS was associated with the insomnia phecode in controls (OR=1.19, p=9.64e-33) but not in BD cases (OR=1, p=0.95). Associations between insomnia PRS and SUD phecodes were significant in BD cases and controls with the effect of the association between insomnia PRS and SUD being stronger in BD cases (interaction p=0.024).

However, identifying proteomic prognostic markers for AD is challenging by their high dimensionality and inherent correlations.  MethodsOur study analyzed 1128 plasma proteins, measured by the SOMAscan platform, from 858 participants 55 years and older (mean age 63 years, 52.9% women) of the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. We conducted regression analysis and machine learning models, including LASSO-based Cox proportional hazard regression model (LASSO) and generalized boosted regression model (GBM), to identify protein prognostic markers. These markers were used to construct a weighted proteomic composite score, the AD prediction performance of which was assessed using time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). The association between the composite score and memory domain was examined in 339 (of the 858) participants with available memory scores, and in an independent group of 430 participants younger than 55 years (mean age 46, 56.7% women).  ResultsOver a mean follow-up of 20 years, 132 (15.4%) participants developed AD. After adjusting for baseline age, sex, education, and APOE {varepsilon}4+ status, regression models identified 309 proteins (P [&le;] 0.2). After applying machine learning methods, nine of these proteins were selected to develop a composite score. This score improved AD prediction beyond the factors of age, sex, education, and APOE {varepsilon}4+ status across 15 to 25 years of follow-up, achieving its peak AUC of 0.84 in the LASSO model at the 22-year follow-up. It also showed a consistent negative association with memory scores in 339 participants (beta = -0.061, P = 0.046), 430 independent participants (beta = -0.060, P = 0.018), and the pooled 769 samples (beta = -0.058, P = 0.003).  ConclusionThese findings highlight the utility of proteomic markers in improving AD prediction and emphasize the complex pathology of AD. The composite score may aid early AD detection and efficacy monitoring, warranting further validation in diverse populations."

These studies predominantly rely on a limited pre-intervention period and tend to focus on the very short run neglecting that Swedish health authorities emphasized that their public health strategy was designed for the long run. This paper handles these shortcomings expanding both the pre- and post-intervention period considerably using weekly mortality rates. I find no significant effect of the absence of lockdown on COVID-19 mortality neither in the short or long run. Using the timing of the winter holiday as a proxy for the extent/spread of COVID-19 in societies before lockdown - a variable which is unobservable due to limited testing - I suggest that the effect of lockdowns found in earlier studies using Sweden as a control are likely to be partially driven by unobserved variables rather than policies.

There is therefore still a need to develop new tools to improve treatment outcomes for breast cancer patients. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a wealth of information about patients, from pathological reports to biological measurements, that could be useful towards this end but remain mostly unexploited. Recent methodological developments in deep learning, however, open the way to developing new methods to leverage this information to improve patient care.  MethodsIn this study, we propose M-BEHRT, a Multimodal BERT for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data based on BEHRT, itself an architecture based on the popular natural langugage architecture BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). M-BEHRT models multimodal patient trajectories as a sequence of medical visits, which comprise a variety of information ranging from clinical features, results from biological lab tests, medical department and procedure, and the content of free-text medical reports. M-BEHRT uses a pretraining task analog to a masked language model to learn a representation of patient trajectories from data that includes data that is unlabeled due to censoring, and is then fine-tuned to the classification task at hand. Finally, we used a gradient-based attribution method -to highlight which parts of the input patient trajectory were most relevant for the prediction.  ResultsWe apply M-BEHRT to a retrospective cohort of about 15 000 breast cancer patients from Institut Curie (Paris, France) treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, using patient trajectories for up to one year after surgery to predict disease-free survival (DFS). M-BEHRT achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.77 [0.70-0.84] on a held-out data set for the prediction of DFS 3 years after surgery, compared to 0.67 [0.58-0.75] for the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) and for a random forest (p-values = 0.031 and 0.050 respectively).  In addition, we identified subsets of patients for which M-BEHRT performs particularly well such as older patients with at least one lymph node affected.  ConclusionIn conclusion, we proposed a novel deep learning algorithm to learn from multimodal EHR data. Learning from about 15 000 patient records, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two classification tasks. The EHR data used to perform these tasks was more homogeneous compared to other datasets used for pretraining, as it exclusively comprised adjuvant treated breast cancer patients. This highlights both the potential of EHR data for improving our understanding of breast cancer and the ability of transformer-based architectures to learn from EHR data containing much fewer than the millions of records typically used in currently published studies. The representation of patient trajectories used by M-BEHRT captures their sequential aspect, and opens new research avenues for understanding complex diseases and improving patient care."

We aim to build a generalizable, automated data extraction workflow leveraging large language models (LLMs) that mimics the real-world two-reviewer process.  Materials and MethodsA dataset of 10 clinical trials (22 publications) from a published LSR was used, focusing on 23 variables related to trial, population, and outcomes data. The dataset was split into prompt development (n=5) and held-out test sets (n=17). GPT-4-turbo and Claude-3-Opus were used for data extraction. Responses from the two LLMs were compared for concordance. In instances with discordance, original responses from each LLM were provided to the other LLM for cross-critique. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, were used to assess performance against the manually curated gold standard.  ResultsIn the prompt development set, 110 (96%) responses were concordant, achieving an accuracy of 0.99 against the gold standard. In the test set, 342 (87%) responses were concordant. The accuracy of the concordant responses was 0.94. The accuracy of the discordant responses was 0.41 for GPT-4-turbo and 0.50 for Claude-3-Opus. Of the 49 discordant responses, 25 (51%) became concordant after cross-critique, with an increase in accuracy to 0.76.  DiscussionConcordant responses by the LLMs are likely to be accurate. In instances of discordant responses, cross-critique can further increase the accuracy.  ConclusionLarge language models, when simulated in a collaborative, two-reviewer workflow, can extract data with reasonable performance, enabling truly  living systematic reviews."

Yet, predictive models in the neurobiomedical domain suffer from a lack of generalizability and replicability so that transitioning models from prototyping to clinical applications still poses challenges. Key contributors to these challenges are confounding effects; in particular the oftentimes purely statistical perspective on confounding. However, complementing these statistical considerations with causal reasoning from domain knowledge can make predictive models a tool for causal biomedical inference beyond associative insights. Such causal insights give answers to biomedical questions of how and why, arguably what most biomedical investigations ultimately seek for. Here, we suggest a 5-step approach for targeted, context-informed deconfounding. We exemplify the 5-step approach with a real-world neurobiomedical predictive task using data from the UK Biobank. The core of this approach constitutes a bottom-up causal analysis to identify a correct set of deconfounders and the appropriate deconfounding method for a given causal predictive endeavour. Using the 5-step approach to combine causal with statistical confounder considerations can make predictive models based on observational (big) data a technique comparable to Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). Through causally motivated deconfounding we aim at facilitating the development of reliable and trustworthy AI as a medical tool. In addition, we aim to foster the relevance of low performing or even null result models if they originate from a ""skilful interrogation of nature"", i.e. a deconfounding strategy derived from an adequate causal and statistical analysis. Ultimately, causal predictive modelling through appropriate deconfounding can contribute to mutual recursive feedback loops of causal insights across disciplines, scales and species that enable the field to disentangle the cause-effect structure of neurobiomedical mechanisms."

However, comprehensive cervical cancer screening programs for this population are still lacking in Indonesia. This has resulted in many cases of late-stage cervical cancer being diagnosed, especially in Bali, which has experienced an increase in cases of HIV and cervical cancer. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for cervical cytological abnormalities in women living with HIV in Bali and to explore their relationship with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) types.  MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study with eligible participants recruited from outpatient HIV clinics in Bali. Between July to December 2023, participants were interviewed to collect demographic and historical medical information, followed by physical examination including collection of cervical swabs and blood samples. Pap smear sampling and swab collection using ThinPrep for cytology. HPV DNA was then identified by PCR and genotyped for HR-HPV 16,18,31,33,35,39,45,51,52,56,58,59,66,68. Blood samples were analyzed for CD4 and CD8 cell counts.  ResultsA total of 245 women with HIV at median age of 38 years old (24-50 years) and with median time of ARV therapy of 7 years (0-18 years) were enrolled. Only 239 participants were included in the analysis for their valid initial results. Overall, 26 (10.87%) of samples showed abnormal cytology including 6 (2.5%) ASC-H, 9 (3.8%) ASC-US, 4 (1.7%) H-SIL and 7 (2.9%) L-SIL. Of the 58 (24%) that tested positive for HPV DNA, 18 (31%) samples had abnormal cytology. HPV 18 was the most common genotype detected (n=16 or 28%). Bivariate analysis revealed a significant association between positive HPV DNA and abnormal cytology, with those testing HPV-positive having seven times higher risk of ASC-US or greater (PR=7.022;95%CI=3.223-15.295). Multivariate regression identified having HPV 18 infection as an independent risk factor for abnormal cytology (ExpB=9.029;p=0.007), and a history of Pap smear screening associated with reduced risk of HR-HPV infection (ExpB=0.358;p=0.013).  ConclusionIn our study, 10.87% of women living with HIV had abnormal cytology and 24% had positive HPV DNA tests. HPV 18 was associated with a greater risk of abnormal cytology compared to other high-risk HPV strains, but our sample size was small. History of pap smear was also shown to decrease the risk of HR-HPV infection. The results underscore the need for increased vaccination of younger women and screening of all women living with HIV in Indonesia in order to improve their cervical health outcomes."

ObjectivesThe main objective of this analysis was to investigate the statistical properties and potential utility of indices estimating the vasopressor dose-rates as a function of blood pressure values over time.  MethodsIn this single-center observational study, we collected blood pressure values from intensive care unit (ICU) monitors and norepinephrine dose-rates from infusion pumps corresponding to a derivation and a validation cohort. Patients included in each cohort were 18 years or older and received norepinephrine in the ICU. We defined and derived indices corresponding to vasopressor therapy above (>65 mmHg) and below (<60 mmHg) targets. We report the distribution of both indices over time from both cohorts as well as their associations with hospital mortality using logistic regression models adjusted for baseline variables.  ResultsBetween July 30 2020 and March 28 2022, 283 patients were included in the derivation cohort. The median ICU stay was 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 2-10.5) and the median duration of norepinephrine therapy was 27.3 hours (IQR 13.9-54.2). The median cumulative time with a MAP below 60 mmHg was 0.9 hours (IQR 0.2-3.1), whereas the cumulative time with a MAP above 65 mmHg was 22.5 hours (IQR 10.9-40.4). Adjusting for prespecified baseline variables, the above target index was associated with hospital mortality (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 -2.3) but not the below target index (OR 1.1 95% CI 0.8 - 1.5). Between May 5 2022 and December 16 2022, 83 patients were included in the validation cohort. The duration of ICU stay and the proportion of norepinephrine exposure above MAP target were consistent with the derivation cohort. The point estimates of the associations between each index and mortality were also consistent with the derivation cohort, but not statistically significant.  ConclusionIndices of vasopressor administration as a function of blood pressure suggest that during most of vasopressor therapy episodes, patients are treated above target. The association of these indices with patient outcomes remains uncertain but could be explored in larger datasets, and future clinical trials of target MAPs may consider measurement of these indices to adjust results for treatment adherence."

The SNT process included the formation of an SNT team, determination of criteria for targeting interventions, data assembly and review, stratification, application of targeting criteria to determine preliminary plans, mathematical modeling, finalization of intervention plans, and monitoring and evaluation of the eventual implemented plan, all under the leadership of the NMP. Analysis steps of SNT were supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners. As SNT was a new approach, this study used semi-structured interviews to understand the perspectives and experiences of personnel from five NMPs (Burkina Faso, Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, and Togo) that undertook SNT between 2019 and 2023. Participants reported that SNT outputs were used to inform national strategic plans and prioritized plans, that the process incentivized improvements in data collection and data quality, and that NMPs were strongly motivated to grow their capacity to conduct more steps of the SNT analysis process internally. Major challenges included the lack of resources available to implement the full strategic plans as well as challenges with data quality and alignment of stakeholders. Participants reported a moderate to strong sense of ownership over the process and were eager to extend, adapt, and reuse the SNT process in the future. Among countries supported by WHO, SNT was well-accepted and allowed NMPs to successfully use evidence to inform their decision-making, advocate for themselves, and mobilize resources."

ObjectivesThe CLADRIPLAS study examined the effect of cladribine on peripheral and intrathecal B and plasma cell biology in people with MS.  MethodsThirty-eight people with progressive MS ineligible for- or rejecting-treatment with licenced therapies were recruited and supplied a baseline lumbar puncture. Those exhibiting gadolinium-enhancing or new/enlarging T2 magnetic resonance imaging lesions and/or elevated neurofilament levels were offered subcutaneous cladribine (Litak(R)). Seven people were eligible; one person died before treatment, and only five completed the first year of treatment. Twenty-two ineligible people were willing to provide a repeat lumbar puncture twelve months later.  ResultsThe CLADRIPLAS study found no evidence of a difference in the odds of a positive cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band (cOCB) result between the cladribine-treated and untreated group. This is probably explained by microarray and in vitro studies, which demonstrated that plasmablasts and notably long-lived plasma cells are relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effect of cladribine compared to memory B cells at physiological concentrations. This was consistent with the loss of intracellular deoxycytidine kinase during antibody-secreting cell differentiation.  DiscussionCLADRIPLAS indicates that cOCB are not rapidly eliminated in most people with MS. This may be explained by the relative lack of direct cytotoxic action of cladribine on long-lived plasma cells."

Yet, the diagnostic error of patients consciousness states can reach up to forty percent5,6, resulting in a worse prognosis. Neuronal mechanisms underlying the disorders are indispensable for identifying objective and intrinsic markers of consciousness. As the principal relay station between the brainstem arousal nuclei and the cerebral cortex, the thalamus has been empirically inferred to maintain consciousness and wakefulness within the brain connectome7-12. Here, we investigated thalamic spiking, brain connections, consciousness states, and outcomes following deep brain stimulation in 29 patients. Our study reveals that thalamic activities can signal their consciousness states. Patients diagnosed with vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome exhibited less active neurons with longer and more variable burst discharges compared to those in a minimally conscious state. Furthermore, as a direct deep brain stimulation site, neuronal profiles in the centromedian/parafascicular complex of the thalamus indicated whether electrostimulation here improved outcomes. Stronger tonic firing was associated with enhanced thalamocortical connections and better recovery outcomes in patients. These findings suggest that thalamic spiking signatures, including single-neuron burst discharge and tonic firing, selectively indicate the representation and alteration of consciousness. These findings provide direct neuronal and clinical evidence for understanding of thalamic contributions to disorders of consciousness."

However, previous research has been limited to correlational studies. Here, we conducted an RCT with preterm neonates to determine whether increased exposure to maternal speech during NICU hospitalization is causally linked to structural white matter maturation.  MethodsWe enrolled 46 preterm neonates (24-31 weeks gestational age). Participants were randomly assigned to receive increased (T: n=21) or routine (C: n=25) exposure to mothers speech. The T-group heard 10-minute audio recordings of their mothers reading a childrens story two times/hour between 10pm-6am, increasing speech exposure by 2.67 hours/day. At near-term-equivalent age, we obtained two high-angular resolution diffusion MRI (scan 1 bvalue=700, scan 2 bvalue=1500) and quantitative T1 relaxometry scans. We assessed mean diffusivity (MD), pre-registered primary outcome (NCT02847689), of the left and right arcuate fasciculus, tracts implicated in language processing.  Secondary outcomes included fractional anisotropy (FA) and R1 (1/T1).  FindingsT- and C-groups were equivalent on medical and demographic variables. Compared to the C- group, the T-group demonstrated significantly lower MD in the left (scan 1: mean difference{Delta} =0.11, 95% CI:0.03 - 0.19; scan 2:{Delta} =0.13, 95% CI:0.04 - 0.21) but not right arcuate (scan 1:{Delta} =0.06, 95% CI: -0.23 - 0.15; scan 2:{Delta} =0.05, 95% CI:-0.05 - 0.13). The T-group also demonstrated significantly higher FA (scan 1:{Delta} = -0.02, 95% CI:-0.04 - -0.00; scan 2:{Delta} = -0.03, 95% CI:-0.06 - -0.00) and R1 ({Delta} =-0.02, 95% CI:-0.04 - -0.01) in the left but not right arcuate.  InterpretationPreterm neonates who experienced increased exposure to maternal speech during hospitalization demonstrated more mature microstructure of the left arcuate. Findings provide evidence for a causal link between speech experiences and brain development. Increasing speech exposure in the NICU may benefit preterm children.  Research in Context PanelO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSObservational studies document the importance of early speech experience for language learning and brain development in term and preterm children. Children born preterm are at-risk for adverse language outcomes that have been attributed to alterations in brain development from limited exposure to speech in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, evidence that early speech experiences causally effect the development of brain structures relevant for language is lacking.  Added value of this studyThe Listening to Mom in NICU study is the first randomized controlled trial specifically designed to test the causal effects of maternal speech exposure on white matter brain development in neonates born preterm. This study demonstrates that speech experiences during neonatal development directly contribute to the maturation of the left arcuate fasciculus, a white matter tract implicated in language.  Implications of all the available evidenceStudy findings advance understandings for how early speech experiences contribute to neonatal brain development. This study also demonstrates that increasing exposure to speech via audio recordings among infants born preterm could serve as an inexpensive and scalable intervention to support recovery from alterations in brain development related to the NICU experience."

The BF+/- is the ratio of the probability of the data under H+ (pharmacological treatment is beneficial) over the probability of the data under H- (pharmacological treatment is harmful).  ResultsFive RCTs were included (1341 infants). BMA showed strong evidence in favor of a harmful effect of medication for BPD (BF+/-=0.02) and BPD or death (BF+/- =0.03). When the two largest trials, which used early (<72 h) ibuprofen in infants with GA [&le;]28 weeks, were pooled, the BMA demonstrated moderate evidence in favor of higher mortality in the medication group (BF+/-=0.24).  ConclusionsEarly ibuprofen treatment of a PDA in extremely preterm infants may result in more complications than clinical benefit."

With the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the subsequent changes in respiratory viral circulation, it is crucial to reassess RSV-associated healthcare burden in adults. This study assessed RSV-associated healthcare burden in adults in six European countries before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.  MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis using national hospital admissions data from Denmark, England, Finland, the Netherlands, Scotland, and regional surveillance data from the Valencia region (Spain). We included patients aged [&ge;]18 years hospitalised for respiratory tract infections (RTIs) from 2016 to 2023. We assessed RSV-coded and laboratory-confirmed hospitalisations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, in-hospital length of stay (LOS), and mortality.  ResultsRSV-associated hospitalisations significantly reduced during the 2020/2021 season across all countries, coinciding with strict COVID-19 preventive measures, but resurged in subsequent seasons. We observed the highest hospitalisation rates in adults aged [&ge;]85 years. RSV-coded hospitalisations were found to underestimate the true burden when compared with laboratory-confirmed cases. Underestimation factors ranged from 1.1 to 4.3 times across countries. No significant differences were observed in LOS or ICU admission rates for RSV-associated hospitalisations compared to RTIs.  DiscussionOur findings underscore the complex epidemiology of RSV in older adults. The differences between RSV-coded and laboratory-confirmed cases highlight the critical need for improved surveillance and diagnostic practices to better assess the true burden. Our findings could be vital for guiding public health strategies, particularly with the recent introduction of RSV vaccines for older adults."

MethodsAn institutional database of 357 patients with intracranial bypass procedures between 08/2001-05/2022 was retrospectively reviewed. Patients with bypass for all causes (e.g., aneurysm, atherosclerotic disease, Moyamoya disease) were included. Medical history, surgical technique, and flow-related measurements (intraoperatively and on quantitative MRA at follow-up) were compared across biological sex and in relation to bypass patency.  ResultsOf 357 patients, 141 were male (39.5%) and 216 were female (60.5%) with average age 49.0+/-16.7. Bypass patency at last follow-up was 84.4% for men vs. 69.2% for women (p=0.001). Significant differences were seen in underlying diagnoses, with more aneurysm and Moyamoya cases represented in female sex (p<0.001); irrespective of diagnosis, lower patency rates were seen in women when considering bypass for aneurysm (p=0.032), Moyamoya disease (p=0.035), and for atherosclerotic disease (p=0.159). Medical comorbidities were seen at higher rates in men, with comorbidity score 2.7 vs. 2.1 (p<0.001). Cut flow was higher in men 59.2 vs. 51.1 (p=0.028), but no significant differences were seen in intraoperative bypass flow, cut flow index (CFI), or follow-up QMRA. After removing cases using interposition grafts, similar differences were redemonstrated. Propensity score matched analysis found females have a 2.71 higher chance of bypass occlusion after adjusting for CFI (p=0.017, 95% CI: 1.19-6.18).  ConclusionBiological sex appears to play a significant role in bypass patency, across diagnoses. Women were significantly less likely to have patent bypasses at last follow-up, despite having less medical comorbidities than men and despite having similar intraoperative and perioperative flows. Further study is required to better elucidate the influence of sex on long-term bypass patency."

Despite the availability of large open-source data fueling a wealth of promising research, effective translation of preclinical findings to clinical practice remains difficult. This barrier is largely due to the complexity of unstructured and disparate preclinical and clinical data, which traditional analytical methods struggle to handle. Novel analytical techniques involving Deep Learning (DL), however, are gaining significant traction in this regard. Here, we have investigated the potential of a cascaded multimodal DL-based system (TelDem), assessing the ability to integrate and analyze a large, heterogeneous dataset (n=7159 patients), applied to three clinically relevant use cases. Using a Cascaded Multi-Modal Mixing Transformer (CMT), we assessed TelDems validity and (using a Cross Modal Fusion Norm - CMFN) model explainability in (i) differential diagnosis between healthy individuals, AD, and three sub-types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ii) disease staging from healthy cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, and (iii) predicting progression from MCI to AD. Our findings show that the CMT enhances diagnostic and prognostic accuracy when incorporating multimodal data compared to unimodal modeling and that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers play a key role in accurate model decision making. These results reinforce the power of DL technology in tapping deeper into already existing data, thereby accelerating preclinical dementia research by utilizing clinically relevant information to disentangle complex dementia pathophysiology."

An increasing number of reports have attempted to explore the genetic connection between blood lipids and the risk of developing breast cancer. However, observational studies can be affected by confounding factors and reverse causation, which can compromise the reliability of the findings. We used univariate and multivariable two-sample mendelian randomization to explore the causal association between blood lipids and breast cancer. Summary-level data for lipid traits were obtained from the Africa Wits-INDEPTH partnership for Genomic Research (AWI-Gen) (N= 10,603, 58.5% of women). For breast cancer, we leveraged summary statistics from the most comprehensive Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) on breast cancer consisting of 18,034 cases and 22,104 controls of women of African ancestry. Our analysis suggests that genetically predicted triglycerides had a potential protective effect on breast carcinoma (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.56, 0.95, FDR = 0.001). We found no evidence that genetically elevated levels of TC, HDL, and LDL may be associated with the risk of breast cancer TC (OR = 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93, 1.18; FDR = 0.029); HDL (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.93, 1.79, FDR = 0.008); LDL (OR = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.90, 1.20, FDR = 0.036). Multivariate mendelian randomization analysis, which adjusted for the effects of TG, TC, LDL, and HDL, attenuated the observation of TG and breast cancer and also found no relationship between TC, HDL, LDL, and breast cancers. Furthermore, there was no evidence for a causal association between lipid traits and breast cancer subtypes. Our findings were robust in several sensitivity analyses. This study provides strong evidence that circulating TG may be associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer, while TC, LDL and HDL may not be related to the risk of breast cancer among African women."

Utilizing open-source methods, this study aimed to explore whether an immune cell score can be facilitated by focusing on single T-cell markers, to provide a simplified prognostic model in non-metastatic CRC.  MethodsA multicentric prospective cohort study was conducted in non-metastatic CRC patients who underwent curative surgical resection. CD3+ and CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were quantified in both invasive margin (IM) and tumor core (TC) using QuPath. A composite score, termed immune cell score, mirroring the methods employed for the Immunoscore(R), was calculated based on the TIL densities (CD3-IM, CD8-IM, CD3-TC, CD8-TC]. We used a split sample approach (70:30) to estimate adjusted hazard ratios of cancer-specific survival (CSS) in a training and a validation set. Classification and regression tree analysis (CART) was performed to select the most prognostic TIL. The model incorporating the CART-selected TIL was compared to a two-tiered immune cell score model for overall performance (Brier score) and discrimination (concordance probability estimate, CPE).  ResultsDuring a median follow-up time of 9.0 years, among 1260 patients, there were 203 CRC specific deaths. CART-selected CD8-IM was the most prognostic TIL at a cut-off of 231 cells/mm2. Patients with CD8-IMHi had better CSS than CD8-IMLow in both training (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.40-0.84) and validation sets (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.21-0.60). Brier scores of CD-8IM and immune cell score survival models were comparable in both training and validation cohort, whereas the survival discrimination of CD8-IM slightly outperformed the immune cell score in the validation set (CPE: CD8-IM 0.748, IS 0.730).  ConclusionA single TIL marker, specifically CD8-IM, provided prognostic information comparable to the immune cell score. Simplified and cost-effective TIL assessments could enhance their bench to bedside translation and may guide adjuvant therapy in early-stage CRC."

Variability in metabolic profiles, influenced by genetic makeup, lifestyle, and environmental exposures, plays a critical role in disease susceptibility and progression.  MethodsWe conducted a two-year longitudinal study involving 101 clinically healthy individuals aged 50 to 65, integrating genomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, proteomics, clinical measurements, and lifestyle questionnaire data from repeat sampling. We evaluated the influence of both external and internal factors, including genetic predispositions, lifestyle factors, and physiological conditions, on individual metabolic profiles. Additionally, we developed an integrative metabolite-protein network to analyze protein-metabolite associations under both genetic and environmental regulations.  ResultsOur findings highlighted the significant role of genetics in determining metabolic variability, identifying 22 plasma metabolites as genetically predetermined. Environmental factors such as seasonal variation, weight management, smoking, and stress also significantly influenced metabolite levels. The integrative metabolite-protein network comprised 5,649 significant protein-metabolite pairs and identified 87 causal metabolite-protein associations under genetic regulation, validated by showing a high replication rate in an independent cohort. This network revealed stable and unique protein-metabolite profiles for each individual, emphasizing metabolic individuality. Notably, our results demonstrated the importance of plasma proteins in capturing individualized metabolic variabilities. Key proteins representing individual metabolic profiles were identified and validated in the UK Biobank, showing great potential for predicting metabolic diseases and metabolic risk assessment.  ConclusionsOur study provides longitudinal insights into how genetic and environmental factors shape human metabolic profiles, revealing unique and stable individual metabolic profiles. Plasma proteins emerged as key indicators for capturing the variability in human metabolism and assessing metabolic risks. These findings offer valuable tools for personalized medicine and the development of diagnostics for metabolic diseases."

Latin American samples are significantly underrepresented in global cancer genomics studies, which directly affects patients in these regions as it is known that cancer risk and incidence may be influenced by ancestry and environmental exposures. To address this, here we characterise the genome and transcriptome of 128 acral melanoma tumours from 96 Mexican patients, a population notable because of its genetic admixture. Compared with other studies of melanoma, we found fewer frequent mutations in classical driver genes such as BRAF, NRAS or NF1. While most patients had predominantly Amerindian genetic ancestry, those with higher European ancestry had increased frequency of BRAF mutations and a lower number of structural variants. These BRAF-mutated tumours have a transcriptional profile similar to cutaneous non-volar melanocytes, suggesting that acral melanomas in these patients may arise from a distinct cell of origin compared to other tumours arising in these locations. KIT mutations were found in a subset of these tumours, and transcriptional profiling defined three expression clusters; these characteristics were associated with overall survival. We highlight novel low-frequency drivers, such as SPHKAP, which correlate with a distinct genomic profile and clinical characteristics.

However, multiple distinct sets of genes are linked to different AUBs, which may explain their dramatic variability in risk factors and manifestations. In this study, we explore whether intermediate neurobiological traits and alcohol-related cognitions mediate the relationship between polygenic scores (PGS) and multiple AUBs, with the aim to better understand processes captured by different genetic profiles.  MethodsUsing results from prior genome-wide association studies, we derived PGS for 6 AUBs in participants from Spit for Science, a longitudinal study of college students in the U.S. (n=4,549). Self-report measures included personality traits, alcohol expectancies, drinking motivations, and alcohol sensitivity measures as well as drinking frequency, drinking quantity, alcohol use disorder (AUD) symptoms, and maximum drinks in 24 hours. Using linear regression and multiple mediation models, we investigated the direct and indirect effects of PGS on AUBs.  ResultsIn univariable regression results, PGSs indexing broad AUB dimensions such as drinks per week (DPW) and AUD predicted higher levels of sensation-seeking and multiple drinking motives, while BeerPref PGSs (indexing a variable pattern of alcohol problems associated with a preference for beer) predicted higher negative urgency and lower alcohol sensitivity. Mediational models indicated strong direct and indirect effects of DPW PGSs on multiple AUBs via social/enhancement drinking motives and alcohol sensitivity, indirect effects of AUD PGSs on AUD symptoms via coping motives, and indirect effects of BeerPref PGS on all AUBs via the joint effect of mediators including alcohol sensitivity.  ConclusionsThese findings provide initial evidence that the genetic influences on different AUBs are associated with and partially mediated by intermediate neurobiological and cognitive factors, which may be more amenable to intervention. Greater focus on drinking motives and alcohol sensitivity is warranted in genetic research, as well as attention to the heterogeneous pathways linking genes to alcohol use outcomes."

Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including injectable naltrexone, are crucial for treating OUD and especially important for individuals transitioning out of correctional facilities and back into the community. Unfortunately, few formerly incarcerated individuals are able to access MOUD upon community reentry, remaining at high risk of overdose and rearrest. Community pharmacists are a promising resource for providing injectable naltrexone to formerly incarcerated individuals using this treatment option, but are underutilized during reentry planning and by formerly incarcerated individuals upon release. This is due, in large part, to several barriers that exist across the socioecological scale. Accordingly, this study utilized a participatory design process to inform an intervention that address these barriers and improves access to community pharmacist-provided injectable naltrexone for formerly incarcerated individuals upon community reentry. Three iterative focus groups were conducted with five community pharmacists who have experience providing injectable naltrexone and treating formerly incarcerated patients. The goals of each focus group were to: 1) discuss perceptions of existing barriers and prioritize barriers to be addressed, 2) discuss and rank potential interventions to address the prioritized barriers, and 3) discuss components and anticipated challenges related to the prioritized intervention. Focus groups were analyzed via deductive content analysis using a priori categories. Based on discussions of perceived impact and feasibility, the participants prioritized two barriers to be addressed: lack of awareness of community pharmacist-provided injectable naltrexone services and lack of interagency collaboration among primary care clinics, community pharmacies, and correctional facilities. The final intervention included pharmacist-led educational meetings with correctional providers and reentry staff. Several intervention components and anticipated challenges were also identified. Next steps include developing, implementing, and evaluating the efficacy of the intervention on improving access to community pharmacist-provided injectable naltrexone for formerly incarcerated individuals."

PSB can co-occur with reward deficiency syndrome (RDS), but this relationship remains unclear. RDS has been associated with the 10/10 genotype of 3 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) in the dopamine transporter gene SLC6A3, which is implicated in the reward pathway. This study investigates the genetic relationship between PSB and RDS, testing their association with SLC6A3 3 VNTR genotype.  MethodsPSB patients from addiction treatment facilities (n=454), and comparison participants (with PSB=82; without PSB, n=888) were recruited. PSB was measured by the Sexual Addiction Screening Test-Revised (SAST-R) Core and RDS was measured using a composite variable from a custom test battery. DNA was collected from saliva and buccal swabs. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association of SLC6A3 3 VNTR genotype with PSB and RDS.  ResultsThe 10/10 genotype of SLC6A3 3 VNTR was associated with RDS in a combined analysis of all groups, and with PSB only in comparison participants. In patients, rare SLC6A3 3 VNTR genotypes (3-, 6-, 8-, 11-repeat alleles) were associated with PSB. No genotype showed relationships to RDS in only PSB patients.  ConclusionsThe link of the 10/10 genotype to RDS indicates that PSB could be a manifestation of RDS in non-clinical populations; rare genotypes might be associated with clinical forms of PSB, together with comorbid psychopathology."

A major challenge for bioinformatic tools supporting drug selection is to standardize different annotations (substance, drug name, drug class) to a common level, typically the drug class. While manual classification is time-consuming and potentially biased, existing resources often lack completeness, granularity, or mix up drug classes and drug targets. A structured, automatically built drug ontology such as DrugOn fills these gaps, improving decision support and data-driven research.  MethodsDrugOn integrates information from multiple sources to create a comprehensive drug ontology. It includes categories, molecular targets and additional annotations from DrugBank, ATC, MesH, KEGG and ClueIO. The combination of this data enables accurate identification of drug categories for each drug.  ResultsDrugOns effectiveness was demonstrated by classifying 336 drugs from CIViC. It agreed with manually curated database-derived classifications for 268 out of 282 drugs assessed in translational lymphoma research. In 54 cases, classification was not possible due to data gaps. DrugOn provides a REST API and a front-end application for ontology exploration and automated drug queries.  ConclusionDrugOn, a unified drug ontology, is derived from public datasets and refined by precise processing rules to ensure a reliable, updatable resource for drug information, in precision medicine. It uniquely categorizes drug classes and target proteins, and its structured format, complemented by an accessible API, allows for easy integration into data driven pipelines. Initially tailored for lymphoma research, DrugOns adaptable nature supports broader cancer research applications and potential data source expansions.

Further, many diagnosed with MDD are treatment resistant to traditional antidepressants. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offers promise as an alternative solution, but identifying objective biomarkers for predicting treatment response remains underexplored. Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings are a cost-effective neuroimaging approach, but traditional EEG analysis methods often do not consider patient-specific variations and fail to capture complex neuronal dynamics. To address this, we propose a data-driven approach combining iterated masking empirical mode decomposition (itEMD) and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). Our results demonstrated significant prediction of rTMS outcomes using this approach (Protocol 1: r=0.40, p<0.01; Protocol 2: r=0.26, p<0.05). From the decomposition, we obtained three key oscillations: IMF-Alpha, IMF-Beta, and the remaining residue. We also identified key spatial patterns associated with treatment outcomes for two rTMS protocols: for Protocol 1 (10Hz left DLPFC), important areas include the left frontal and parietal regions, while for Protocol 2 (1Hz right DLPFC), the left and frontal, left parietal regions are crucial. Additionally, our exploratory analysis found few significant correlations between oscillation specific predictive features and personality measures. This study highlights the potential of machine learning-driven EEG analysis for personalized MDD treatment prediction, offering a pathway for improved patient outcomes."

Using a convenience sample of 120 practicing mental health clinicians (82.5% female, 85.6% white, M age = 41.31), we assessed clinician- reported practices about where and how they seek information about psychological science on the internet. Our results showed that freely available resources related to mental health are not a primary source of information for mental health clinicians and that clinicians have low confidence in the veracity of information available through Wikipedia and Wikiversity. Clinicians shared strategies (e.g., implementing verification steps on Wiki platform pages) that could increase clinician confidence in the information provided and their likelihood of using these sites as resources. Overall, this study indicates that mental health clinicians are not regularly using Wiki sites for mental health-related questions, even though they are accessible, regularly updated, and increasingly reliable. Findings suggest that implementing verification steps on Wiki pages could increase clinicians confidence in the information provided and their likelihood in using these sites as resources, however, it remains unclear whether verification steps would lead to more frequent use or how such a system would be implemented through existing platforms. Results will help guide future dissemination efforts to increase the availability and utilization of evidence-based psychological science online for clinicians.  Author SummaryOver the past few decades, we have seen a boom in psychological research and innovation. However, the results of this work exist primarily behind academic firewalls, making it difficult for clinicians to access information describing advancements in their field. As clinicians are best positioned to immediately address the global mental health crisis, their inability to make use of the most up-to-date research has a significant, negative impact on the quality of available mental healthcare. Wikipedia and Wikiversity present a possible solution: they are among the most utilized information sites in the world and could be a great tool for providing mental health clinicians with evidence-based psychological resources. In this study, we surveyed clinicians about their online information-seeking habits and found that Wiki platforms are not a main source of information for clinicians, who reported low confidence in the quality of information on these sites. However, survey results also indicated that implementing verification steps on Wiki pages could increase clinicians confidence and willingness to use them. Our results provide guidance on how evidence-based psychological science can be made available on the internet in a way that will increase its utilization and best support clinicians."

The amygdala is a complex amalgamation of subnuclei with diverse functions but fMRI studies have typically focussed on identifying whole rather than subregional amygdala functional connectivity. This study used high resolution 3T fMRI data to investigate subregional alterations that may differentiate treatment-resistant cohorts from healthy individuals and depressed patients who respond to treatment.  MethodsResting-state fMRI data were obtained in 35 participants diagnosed with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD), 38 healthy control participants (HC), and 35 treatment-sensitive participants (TSD). Seed-based functional connectivity analyses of the three main subregions bilaterally (laterobasal, centromedial and superficial), as well as the whole amygdala, were performed and comparisons made between groups.  ResultsWe found connectivity differences in the right laterobasal amygdala subregion in TRD compared to both groups. TRD patients displayed hypoconnectivity to the right fusiform gyrus relative to HC whereas hyperconnectivity to the left inferior frontal gyrus relative to TSD was identified. No connectivity differences were found for the whole amygdala or any of the other subregions bilaterally.  LimitationsModest sample size and cross-sectional study design are limitations. A causal relationship between functional connectivity alterations and treatment resistance cannot be established.  ConclusionAltered connectivity of the right laterobasal subregion is a distinguishing feature of TRD. These alterations may underlie severe impairments in emotion processing and social functioning that are characteristic of TRD. These results emphasise the need for further investigation of the functional role of the amygdala subregions in depression."

Materials and MethodsFluorescently labelled BMP-7 was delivered to murine lungs via nasal inhalation. Thirty-eight C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: control, BLM and BLM with prodrug BMP-7. We then administered the prodrug BMP-7 and vehicle nasally every 72 hours for 21 days. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from 18 mice, divided into four groups: control, prodrug BMP-7 alone, BLM and BLM with prodrug BMP-7, to assess effects on alveolar macrophages (AM). The expression of ApoE+ AM was compared between normal and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients.  ResultsThe prodrug BMP-7 group showed reduced BALF inflammatory cells and significant fibrosis reduction compared to the BLM group. Western blot showed decreased levels of collagen I, -SMA and fibronectin in the prodrug BMP-7 group, along with downregulation of TGF-{beta}/SMAD signalling. ELISA indicated decreased levels of chemokines CXCL10 and CXCL2 in tissue and BALF. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed a significant increase in bone marrow-derived ApoE+ AM in the BLM group, which was reduced with prodrug BMP-7. Additionally, ApoE+ expression was higher in IPF patients compared to controls.  ConclusionsProdrug BMP-7 shows potential as a therapeutic agent for pulmonary fibrosis by modulating ApoE+ AM."

This study aimed to investigate factors that might influence rural Kenyan womens willingness to self-collect samples for HPV-DNA testing.  MethodsThis study utilized data from a mixed-methods study in Bomet and Kericho Counties, including survey responses from 174 women and semi-structured interviews with a subset of 21 participants. Logistic regression was used to analyze quantitative data and theoretical thematic analysis for qualitative data.  ResultsThe surveyed women had a mean age of 45.2 years, were mainly uninsured (76%) and from low-income households (88.4%). Most participants had heard of cervical cancer (83.2%), yet only 6.4% had ever been screened. However, 76.9% expressed willingness to self-collect samples for HPV-DNA testing. Factors significantly associated with increased self-sampling willingness were cervical cancer awareness (OR=3.49, 95% CI=1.50-8.11), having health workers (OR=1.88, CI=1.23-2.86) and the news media (radio and television) (OR=2.63, CI=1.27-5.48) as primary sources of health information, and ever hearing about cervical cancer from the news media (OR=2.43, CI=1.07-5.51). Conversely, high cervical cancer stigma (OR=0.71, CI=0.57-0.88) and longer travel time of 30 to 120 minutes to the nearest health facility (OR=0.44, CI=0.20-0.93) were associated with decreased willingness. Interview data corroborated these findings.  ConclusionsCervical cancer screening uptake is notably low among rural Kenyan women in Bomet and Kericho Counties. Sample self-collection for HPV-DNA testing appears widely acceptable. A comprehensive approach involving educational outreach, health worker recommendation, and mass media campaigns could enhance cervical cancer screening via self- sampling, potentially reducing the burden of cervical cancer. Future research should employ implementation science methodologies to explore cervical cancer screening uptake via self- sampling, to inform population-based implementation strategies in Kenya."

The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has revolutionized the treatment landscape for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, precise prognostic tools are essential to optimize clinical decision-making in this context.  MethodsThe Brain-Lung Immunotherapy Prognostic (BLIP) score was developed based on a retrospective cohort of NSCLC patients treated with ICIs at Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden. Prognostic factors were identified using both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Internal validation was conducted using bootstrap resampling, penalized Cox regression, k-fold cross-validation, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. External validation was performed using an independent cohort from Sotiria Thoracic Diseases Hospital of Athens, Greece.  ResultsFrom a total cohort of 1844 patients screened across both study sites, 152 patients from Karolinska University Hospital and 116 from Sotiria Thoracic Diseases Hospital of Athens, Greece, were included in the final analysis. Key prognostic factors influencing outcomes included histology, actionable mutations, age at BM diagnosis, and the number of BMs. The BLIP score effectively stratified patients into two prognostic groups: ""Good"" and ""Poor"", with a median overall survival (OS) of 15 and 7 months, respectively (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.4; p < 0.0001). External validation confirmed these findings, showing a significantly lower risk of death for the ""Good"" group compared to the ""Poor"" group (HR: 0.49; p = 0.0063). The models robust prognostic performance was confirmed with an area under the ROC curve of 0.87, highlighting its accuracy in predicting survival outcomes.  ConclusionThe BLIP score provides a reliable, validated prognostic tool for NSCLC patients with BMs undergoing ICI therapy. By integrating both molecular and clinical variables, it offers significant improvements over existing models. Prospective validation could further support its use in personalized treatment strategies, improving clinical outcomes and patient management.

These challenges stem from concerns about the quality, accuracy, and comprehensiveness of LLM-generated answers. Most existing work has focused on fine-tuning LLMs based on foundation models, which have not yet fully addressed accuracy and reliability issues. In this work, we propose an agent-based approach that aims to make LLM-based systems clinically deployable for precision oncology, while mitigating common pitfalls such as hallucinations, incoherence, and ""lost-in-the-middle"" problems. To achieve this, we implemented an agentic architecture, fundamentally shifting an LLMs role from a simple response synthesizer to planner. This agent orchestrates a suite of specialized tools that asynchronously retrieve information from various sources. These tools include curated document vector stores encompassing treatment guidelines, genomic data, clinical trial information, drug data, and breast cancer literature. The LLM then leverages its planning capabilities to synthesize information retrieved by these tools, generating comprehensive and accurate responses. We demonstrate GeneSilico Copilots effectiveness in the domain of breast cancer, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy.

These variations can include deletions, duplications, and more complex rearrangements, and play a critical role in cancer progression by amplifying oncogenes, deleting tumor suppressor genes, or altering other key genomic regions. Despite the importance of CNVs in cancer biology, there is a lack of comprehensive resources that aggregate CNV data across multiple cancer types, impeding the exploration of their role in different malignancies. The PanCNV-Explorer was developed to fill this gap by providing a pan-cancer resource that integrates CNV data for over 21 cancer types.  MethodsThe PanCNV-Explorer was developed, utilizing data from repositories such as COSMIC, DepMap, DGV, and dbVAR. Amplifications and deletions can be visualized, with detailed chromosome-specific plots highlighting CNV patterns. In addition, a genome browser has been implemented to display regions of interest for searching for genes of potential relevance.  ResultsThe database contains over 5 million CNVs from 15,809 samples, spanning 21 primary cancer types. Pathogenic CNVs from ClinVar and DepMap were compared to benign data from DGV and dbVAR, allowing a comprehensive analysis across tissues. CNV patterns were visualized for individual cancers. We demonstrate with use cases, focusing on common oncogenes such as MYC and tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, the ability of the resource to search for cancer driver genes. For example, chromosome 12 in pancreatic cancer showed frequent amplifications in the region containing the KRAS oncogene. In another example, we show how driver gene candidates already described in certain cancer entities can also be found with high frequency in other entities.  ConclusionThe PanCNV-Explorer provides a valuable resource for pan-cancer CNV analysis, facilitating the exploration of CNV-driven tumor heterogeneity. The integrated visualization tools and genome browser enable detailed exploration of genomic regions, enhancing cancer research. As a valuable and easy-to-use platform that allows researchers to quantify and compare CNVs across cancer types, the PanCNV-Explorer is an essential tool for advancing cancer genomics research.

We analyzed retrospective EMG and gait data from 167 patients with CP before and after surgery and from 117 typically developed individuals as a reference group. The patients underwent at least one soft tissue surgery on their shank and foot muscles. Using Repeated Measures ANOVA, we examined the norm-distance (ND) of the kinematics, kinetics, and EMG patterns, in addition to the Kerpape-Rennes EMG-based Gait Index (EDI), EMG Profile Score (EPS), and Walking Dynamic Motor Control Index (DMC) before and after surgery. Participants were divided into different response groups (Poor, Mild, and Good gait quality) according to their pre- and post-treatment Gait Deviation Index (GDI), using the K-means-PSO clustering algorithm. The gait and EMG indices were compared between the responders using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. The ND for all kinematics and kinetics parameters significantly improved (p-value < 0.05) after the surgery. Regarding EMG, a significant reduction was only observed in the ND of the rectus femoris (p-value < 0.001) and soleus (p-value = 0.006). Among the indices, DMC was not altered post-operatively (p-value = 0.88). Although EDI and EPS were consistent across responders with a similar pre-treatment gait, a higher DMC was significantly associated with a greater improvement, particularly in patients with poor gait (p-value < 0.05). These findings indicate systematic changes in the EMG of patients with CP following surgery, which can also be demonstrated through indices. DMC is a measure that can potentially serve as a partial predictor of outcomes, particularly in patients with poor pre-operative gait. Future research should investigate the effects of different surgical strategies on the improvement of these patients."

This study examines the socio-economic patterning of dietary behaviour and its correlation with overweight/obesity and CVD biomarkers among Indian adolescents aged 10 to 19 years.  MethodsWe use nationally representative data on dietary patterns and CVD biomarkers from the Comprehensive National Nutrition Dataset, a nationally representative survey of 35,830 adolescents conducted from 2016 to 2018. Dietary pattern is assessed using a summary indicator-Dietary Diversity Score based on 17 specific food groups. Overweight/obesity and the biomarkers, including the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, serum triglycerides, hypertension, and pre-diabetic/diabetic, are analysed.  ResultsAdolescents from higher SES have higher dietary diversity than those from lower SES. This socio-economic patterning is concentrated on higher daily consumption of certain foods such as fats and oil, sugar and jaggery and those high in fats, sugar, and salt (HFSS) comprising-junk food, fried food, sweets, and aerated drinks among those from high SES and urban areas. This, in turn, may explain the concentration of overweight/obesity in this cohort. The SES gradient in diet, overweight/obesity, and associated CVD biomarkers among Indian adolescents remains positive for the household wealth index (worse health for the more economically advantaged) and urban dwellers. However, it is starting to shift towards negative for maternal education, resulting in an inverted U shape (better health for the lowest and highest socially advantaged, worse health for those in the middle).  ConclusionsThere is a clustering of overweight/obesity and CVD biomarkers among adolescents from urban and wealthier households that may be associated with increased consumption of HFSS in this cohort."

MethodsWe conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Scopus databases for studies published up to July 23, 2024, focusing on the application of LLMs in melanoma. Identified studies were categorized into three subgroups: patient education, diagnosis and clinical management. The review process adhered to PRISMA guidelines, and the risk of bias was assessed using the modified QUADAS-2 tool.  ResultsNine studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies compared various LLM models, while four focused on ChatGPT. Three studies specifically examined multi-modal LLMs. In the realm of patient education, ChatGPT demonstrated high accuracy, though it often surpassed the recommended readability levels for patient comprehension. In diagnosis applications, multi- modal LLMs like GPT-4V showed capabilities in distinguishing melanoma from benign lesions. However, the diagnostic accuracy varied considerably, influenced by factors such as the quality and diversity of training data, image resolution, and the models ability to integrate clinical context. Regarding management advice, one study found that ChatGPT provided more reliable management advice compared to other LLMs, yet all models lacked depth and specificity for individualized decision-making.  ConclusionsLLMs, particularly multimodal models, show potential in improving melanoma care through patient education, diagnosis, and management advice. However, current LLM applications require further refinement and validation to confirm their clinical utility. Future studies should explore fine-tuning these models on large dermatological databases and incorporate expert knowledge."

In this study, we combine methods which leverage the genetics of psychiatric disorders to prioritize potential drug targets and compounds.  MethodsWe used the largest available genome-wide association studies, in European ancestry, of four psychiatric disorders [i.e., attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia] along with genes encoding drug targets. With this data, we conducted drug enrichment analyses incorporating the novel and biologically specific GSA-MiXeR tool. We then conducted a series of molecular trait analyses using large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic datasets sampled from brain and blood tissue. This included the novel use of the UK Biobank proteomic data for a proteome-wide association study of psychiatric disorders. With the accumulated evidence, we prioritize potential drug targets and compounds for each disorder.  FindingsWe reveal candidate drug targets shared across multiple disorders as well as disorder-specific targets. Drug prioritization indicated genetic support for several currently used psychotropic medications including the antipsychotic paliperidone as the top ranked drug for schizophrenia. We also observed genetic support for other commonly used psychotropics (e.g., clozapine, risperidone, duloxetine, lithium, and valproic acid). Opportunities for drug repurposing were revealed such as cholinergic drugs for ADHD, estrogens for depression, and gabapentin enacarbil for schizophrenia. Our findings also indicate the genetic liability to schizophrenia is associated with reduced brain and blood expression of CYP2D6, a gene encoding a metabolizer of drugs and neurotransmitters, suggesting a genetic risk for poor drug response and altered neurotransmission.  InterpretationHere we present a series of complimentary and comprehensive analyses that highlight the utility of genetics for informing drug development and repurposing for psychiatric disorders. Our findings present novel opportunities for refining psychiatric treatment."

While improved LVAD design, and systemic anticoagulation regimen, have helped mitigate thromboembolic risks, ischemic stroke due to adverse thromboembolic events remains a major concern with current LVAD therapies. Improved understanding of embolic events, and embolus movement to the brain, is critical to develop techniques to minimize risks of occlusive embolic events such as a stroke after LVAD implantation. Here, we address this need, and devise a quantitative in silico framework to characterize thromboembolus transport and distrbution in hemodynamics driven by an operating LVAD. We conduct systematic numerical experiments to quantify the source-to-destination transport patterns of thromboemboli as a function of: LVAD outflow graft anastomosis, LVAD operating pulse modulation, thromboembolus sizes, and origin locations of emboli. Additionally, we demonstrate how the resulting embolus distribution patterns compare and correlate with descriptors based solely on hemodynamic patterns such as helicity, vorticity, and wall shear stress. Using the concepts of size-dependent embolus-hemodynamics interactions, and two jet flow model for hemodynamics under LVAD operation as established in our prior works, we gain valuable insights on departure of thromboembolus distribution from flow distribution, and establish that our in silico model can generate deep insights into embolus dynamics which is not otherwise available from standard of care imaging and clinical data."

Pre- and post-season resting-state MEG data were collected from 91 high school football players, of whom 10 were diagnosed with concussion. Data were source-imaged, frequency-transformed and parameterized, and linear mixed models were used to examine effects of concussion on pre-to-post-season changes in neurophysiological activity. Scores on the Post-Concussive Symptom Inventory were correlated with pre-to-post-season neurophysiological changes to determine their clinical relevance. Concussion was associated with increased aperiodic exponents in superior frontal cortices, indicating a relative reduction in cortical excitability. This slowing of aperiodic neurophysiology mediated concussion effects on raw delta and gamma power and was associated with worse cognitive concerns across participants. Pre-to-post-season changes in aperiodic-corrected alpha and theta rhythmic activity were also decreased in posterior cortices in instances of concussion.

Digital health technology (DHT)-derived measures offer potential solutions to provide objective, precise, and sensitive measures that address these limitations. However, the complexity of DHT datasets and the potential to derive numerous digital features that were not previously possible to measure pose challenges, including in selection of the most important digital features and construction of composite digital biomarkers.  MethodsWe present a comprehensive machine learning based framework to construct composite digital biomarkers for progression tracking. This framework consists of a marginal (univariate) digital feature screening, a univariate association test, digital feature selection, and subsequent construction of composite (multivariate) digital disease progression biomarkers using Penalized Generalized Estimating Equations (PGEE). As an illustrative example, we applied this framework to data collected from a PD longitudinal observational study. The data consisted of OpalTM sensor-based movement measurements and MDS-UPDRS Part III scores collected at 3-month intervals for 2 years in 30 PD and 10 healthy control participants.  ResultsIn our illustrative example, 77 out of 235 digital features from the study passed univariate feature screening, with 11 features selected by PGEE to include in construction of the composite digital measure. Compared to MDS-UPDRS Part III, the composite digital measure exhibited a smoother and more significant increasing trend over time in PD groups with less variability, indicating improved ability for tracking disease progression. This digital composite measure also demonstrated the ability to classify between de novo PD and healthy control groups.  ConclusionMeasures from DHTs show promise in tracking neurodegenerative disease progression with increased sensitivity and reduced variability as compared to traditional clinical scores.

Identification and characterization of distinct biological subtypes could help explain this heterogeneity, identify the underlying pathophysiology, and predict disease progression across the subgroups of PD.  ObjectiveWe aimed to compare long-term trajectories of various motor and non-motor clinical features, as well as patterns of brain atrophy between PD subtypes, using longitudinally acquired brain MRIs.  MethodsData on 421 individuals with early-stage PD was retrieved from the Parkinsons Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), with an average follow-up time of 8.2 years until February 2024. Participants were classified into three clinical subtypes at the de novo stage using a previously validated subtyping criteria based on major motor and non-motor classifiers (early cognitive impairment, REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), dysautonomia):  mild-motor predominant (n=223),  intermediate (n=146), and diffuse-malignant (n=52). To investigate the pattern of brain atrophy, we used T1-weighted MRIs from a subset of the PPMI population with at least two MRIs obtained, which consisted of 134 PD individuals and 60 healthy controls. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) maps were calculated and mixed effect models were used to examine the interaction between PD subtypes and rate of atrophy across brain regions, controlling for sex and age at baseline.  ResultsCompared to the  mild motor-predominant subtype, participants who were categorized as diffuse-malignant PD at baseline experienced greater worsening in motor severity (p=0.007), cognition (p<0.0001) and activities of daily living (ADL) (p<0.0001) after 8 years. Individuals with diffuse-malignant PD showed a significantly higher rate of atrophy across multiple brain regions, including precuneus, paracentral lobule, inferior temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and lateral hemisphere of the cerebellum (corrected p<0.05).  ConclusionOur study revealed a distinct pattern of long-term progression in various motor and non-motor clinical outcomes between different subtypes of idiopathic PD. Furthermore, we demonstrated an accelerated atrophy pattern within several brain regions in the diffuse-malignant PD subtype. These findings suggest a more widespread and aggressive neurodegenerative process in a subgroup of people with PD, favoring the existence of diverse underlying pathophysiology with clinical relevance for future precision medicine in PD."

Clinical treatment commonly involves combating Helicobacter pylori(HP), reducing gastric acid secretion, and promoting gastric mucosal protection. Nevertheless, Western medicine often entails various adverse effects and long-term use. Consequently, numerous scholars have redirected their focus towards traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for external treatments of PU due to its minimal toxicity, fewer side effects, and lower recurrence rates. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of Acupoint herbal patching (AHP) in treating PU, offering a foundation for future clinical investigations.  Methods and analysisThe computer will conduct a comprehensive search for relevant studies on the utilization of AHP in the management of PU from the inception of the database in various scholarly platforms including China Journal Network, Wanfang Database, Chongqing Wipo Database, China Biomedical Literature Database, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Eligible literature will undergo meticulous scrutiny based on predefined criteria, with data extraction and quality assessment executed independently by two researchers. Meta-analysis utilizing RevMan 5.4.1 software will be employed to synthesize the collected data. The study will focus on the TCM Symptom Score Scale as the primary outcome measure, while secondary outcomes will encompass serum inflammatory factors, endoscopic findings, quality of life, recurrence rate, and adverse events. Furthermore, assessments on effectiveness, cure rate, and potential publication bias will be carried out. This investigation aims to assess the efficacy of AHP in the treatment of PU and its impact on enhancing the well-being of patients.

Although these are common diagnoses for patients with CHD, limited research has investigated the mechanistic underpinnings of these findings. Our previous research examined the association between abnormal respiratory ciliary motion and brain abnormalities in infants with CHD. Results suggested that abnormal ciliary motion correlated to a spectrum of subtle dysplasia, notably within the olfactory bulb (OB)1. Our current study investigates whether OB anomalies predict neurodevelopmental outcomes for pediatric patients with CHD. We hypothesize that adolescents with CHD who exhibit aberrant morphological measurements in the OB are more likely to suffer from executive functional deficits.  Materials and MethodsA prospective, observational study of 54 CHD and 75 healthy subjects, ages 6-25 years old, was completed under the supervision of a senior pediatric neuroradiologist. T2 3D Space and T2 Blade 2MM MRI images were manually segmented to extract volumetric bilateral regions of the OB and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using ITK-SNAP. Imaging metrics were correlated to OB asymmetry, CSF to OB ratio, total CSF volume, total OB volume, and independent left and right CSF and OB volumes. Linear regression was used to evaluate MRI morphologic measurements with co-variates: CHD status, sex, MRI age, and segmenter. Executive function was determined by the Behavioral Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) Parent Report and Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) for subjects ages 6-16. Cognition and olfactory function were measured with the NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery and Odor Identification Test, respectively.  ResultsNo statistically significant results were reported between cohorts for asymmetry of OB, CSF to OB ratio, total CSF volume, total OB volume, nor between independent left and right CSF and OB volumes. Increased OB volume was associated with worse outcomes on the BRIEF Parent Report (p[&le;]0.03). Asymmetry of OB predicted poorer executive functioning as reported by parents on the BRIEF (p[&le;]0.05). Overall, the CHD cohort demonstrated worse scores on the BRIEF Parent Report compared to controls. Across groups, no significant association was reported for olfaction function measured by the NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test on a limited subset of participants.  ConclusionAs survival rates for CHD improve, there is an increased risk of long-term neurodevelopmental impairments. Our findings identify adolescents who are at risk for executive dysfunction, particularly those showing increased OB volume and/or asymmetry of the OB. This is particularly concerning for the CHD population with atypical OB morphology, who also exhibit significantly poorer outcomes on the BRIEF Parent Report and face a higher overall risk. Increased OB volume and OB asymmetry are olfactory-based biomarkers that may help identify at-risk CHD patients earlier, enabling more timely intervention and support."

ParticipantsAdults with [&ge;]50% predicted six-month mortality risk admitted to three urban hospitals in a single health system. All participants had goals-of-care (GOC) discussions documented in the EHR 6 months before and 6 months after admission manually classified into one of four categories of goals: (1) comfort-focused, (2) maintain or improve function, (3) life-extension, or (4) unclear.  Main MeasuresPairs of physician-coders independently reviewed EHR notes from 6 months before through 6 months after admission to identify and classify care received between each documented GOC discussion into one of the four goals categories. Epochs between GOC discussions were then coded as goal-concordant if GOC and care received classifications were aligned, goal-discordant if they were misaligned, or uncertain if either classification was unclear or not documented. Coder inter-rater reliability was assessed using kappa statistics.  Key ResultsInter-rater reliability for classifying care received was almost perfect (95% interrater agreement; Cohens kappa=0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99). Of 398 total epochs across 109 unique patients, 198 (50%) were goal-concordant, 112 (28%) were of uncertain concordance, and 88 (22%) were goal-discordant. Eighty (73%) patients received care of uncertain concordance during at least one epoch. Forty-eight (44%) patients received goal-discordant care during at least one epoch.  ConclusionsClinician chart review was a feasible method for measuring GCC and can inform natural language processing and machine learning methods to improve the clinical and research utility of this method.

Among the neuropathological theories of MDD, the cortico-limbic dysregulation model has been prominent, and it was recently extended and refined by the framework of imbalanced reciprocal suppression between the FP and limbic compartments. This research aims to examine this refined theory.  MethodsSixty MDD and sixty healthy control datasets, including structural magnetic resonance imaging and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), were selected from the CAN-BIND database. The cerebral cortex in rsfMRI was parcellated by MOSI (modular analysis and similarity measurements). For each parcellated node, the mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF) was computed. Correlation analyses were employed to construct an adjacency matrix between partitioned nodes and to examine the relationship between nodal power and nodal degree.  ResultsTwo-sample t-tests revealed that the limbic system in MDD was associated with a higher partition number and mALFF (p < 0.005). A negative correlation between nodal degree and nodal power was replicated (p < 1E-10), indicating that higher functional input may more effectively suppress regional neural activity. For FP nodal power and Limbic-FP connectivity, the MDD group exhibited a more negative correlation (stronger suppression), while for limbic nodal power and FP-Limbic connectivity, the MDD group showed a less negative correlation (weaker suppression).  ConclusionsConsistent with the inter-compartmental network imbalance framework, MDD is characterized by abnormal cortical signal organization and aberrant reciprocal suppression between the FP and limbic systems."

Consistent with this the antagonistic pleiotropic theory of aging suggests that aging results from the trade-offs that promote early growth and reproduction. However, evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy in humans is largely lacking. Using Mendelian Randomization (MR), we demonstrated that later ages of menarche or first childbirth were genetically associated with longer parental lifespan, decreased frailty index, slower epigenetic aging, later menopause, and reduced facial aging. Moreover, later menarche or first childbirth were also genetically associated with a lower risk of several age-related diseases, including late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), type 2 diabetes, heart disease, essential hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We validated the associations between the age of menarche, childbirth, and the number of childbirths with several age-related outcomes in the UK Biobank by conducting regression analysis of nearly 200,000 subjects. Our results demonstrated that menarche before the age 11 and childbirth before 21 significantly accelerated the risk of several diseases, and almost doubled the risk for diabetes, heart failure, and quadrupled the risk of obesity, supporting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory. We identified 128 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influenced age-related outcomes, some of which were involved in known longevity pathways, including IGF1, growth hormone, AMPK, and mTOR signaling. Our study also identified higher BMI as a mediating factor in causing the increased risk of certain diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart failure, in women with early menarche or early pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of the thrifty gene hypothesis in explaining in part the mechanisms behind antagonistic pleiotropy. Our study highlights the complex relationship between genetic legacies and modern diseases, emphasizing the need for gender-sensitive healthcare strategies that consider the unique connections between female reproductive health and aging."

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventralis intermediate nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus and/or the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) has been shown to provide significant tremor suppression in patients with ET, but with significant inter-patient variability and habituation to the stimulation. Several non-invasive neuromodulation techniques targeting other parts of the central nervous system, including cerebellar, motor cortex, or peripheral nerves, have also been developed for treating ET, but the clinical outcomes remain inconsistent. Existing studies suggest that pathology in ET may emerge from multiple cortical and subcortical areas, but its exact mechanisms remain unclear. By simultaneously capturing neural activities from motor cortices and thalami, and hand tremor signals recorded via accelerometers in fifteen human subjects who have undergone lead implantations for DBS, we systematically characterized the efferent and afferent cortico-thalamic tremor networks. Through the comparisons of these network characteristics and tremor amplitude between DBS OFF and ON conditions, we further investigated the associations between different tremor network characteristics and the magnitude of DBS effect. Our findings implicate the thalamus, specifically the contralateral hemisphere, as the primary generator of tremor in ET, with a significant contribution of the ipsilateral hemisphere as well. Although there is no direct correlation between the cortico-tremor connectivity and tremor power or reduced tremor by DBS, the strength of connectivity from the motor cortex to the thalamus and vice versa at tremor frequency predicts baseline tremor power and effect of DBS. Interestingly, there is no correlation between these two connectivity pathways themselves, suggesting that, independent of the subcortical pathway, the motor cortex appears to play a relatively distinct role, possibly mediated through an afferent/feedback loop in the propagation of tremor. DBS has a greater clinical effect in those with stronger cortico-thalamo-tremor connectivity involving the contralateral thalamus, which is also associated with bigger and more stable tremor measured with an accelerometer. Interestingly, stronger cross-hemisphere coupling between left and right thalami is associated with more unstable tremor. Together this study provides important insights into a better understanding of the cortico-thalamic tremor generating network and its implication for the development of patient-specific therapeutic approaches for ET."

One potential etiology is a patent foramen ovale (PFO), which may contribute to stroke through paradoxical thrombo-embolism or in situ thrombo-embolus formation. Recent advancements in robot-assisted transcranial Doppler (raTCD) have shown increased sensitivity in detecting right-to-left shunt (RLS) compared to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), particularly in detecting large shunts, which are associated with a higher risk of stroke.  MethodsWe conducted a retrospective quality improvement project at our regional stroke center to compare the performance of TTE and raTCD in identifying RLS in ischemic stroke patients. The study involved 148 patients admitted between February 2021 and February 2023. All patients underwent TTE and raTCD with agitated saline bubble contrast, with additional transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) at the treatment teams discretion. The primary metrics analyzed included differences in overall RLS detection and large RLS detection rates for raTCD, TTE and TEE.  ResultsraTCD detected RLS in 60.1% of patients compared to 37.2% with TTE (p = 0.00012), with a 42.6% detection rate for large shunts on raTCD versus 23.0% on TTE (p = 0.00053). The sensitivity and specificity of raTCD were 92% and 87.5%, respectively, compared to 78.57% and 71.43% for TTE, using TEE as the gold standard. Nine patients underwent PFO closure, all correctly identified with large shunts by raTCD, while TTE missed or underestimated the PFO size in 44% of the cases.  ConclusionraTCD significantly outperforms TTE in detecting RLS and large shunts, suggesting its integration into standard PFO workup protocols may enhance secondary stroke prevention. These findings support the adoption of raTCD as a complementary diagnostic tool alongside TTE and TEE for more accurate PFO detection and risk stratification."

Heterozygous pathogenic variants in SPTAN1 are exemplary for this diversity with phenotypes spanning almost the entire spectrum.  MethodsThrough international collaboration we identified 14 families with genetically unsolved distal weakness and unreported heterozygous SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants including frameshift, nonsense and splice-acceptor variants. Clinical data, electrophysiology, muscle CT or MRI and muscle biopsy findings were collected and standardized. SPTAN1 protein, mRNA expression analysis and cDNA sequencing was performed on muscle tissue from two patients.  ResultsAll 20 patients presented with early childhood onset distal weakness. The severity varied both within families and between different families. Foot abnormalities ranged from hammer toes and pes cavus to distal arthrogryposis. Electrophysiology showed mixed myogenic and neurogenic features. Muscle MRI or CT in 10 patients showed fatty infiltration of the distal lower limb anterior compartment and/or selective involvement of the extensor hallucis longus muscle. Muscle biopsy revealed myopathic changes with mild dystrophic and chronic neurogenic changes in 7 patients. Finally, we provide proof for nonsense mediated decay in tissues derived from two patients.  ConclusionsWe provide evidence for the association of SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants with childhood onset distal myopathy in 14 families. This finding extends the phenotypic spectrum of SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants ranging from intellectual disability to distal weakness with a predominant myogenic cause.  KEY MESSAGES{diamond} SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants, including frameshift, nonsense and splice site variants cause a novel childhood onset distal weakness syndrome with primarily skeletal muscle involvement. {diamond}Hereditary motor neuropathies and distal myopathic disorders present a well-known diagnostic challenge as they demonstrate substantial clinical and genetic overlap. The emergence of SPTAN1 loss-of-function variants serves as a noteworthy example, highlighting a growing convergence in the spectrum of genotypes linked to both hereditary motor neuropathies and distal myopathies."

The intracranial location limits serial biopsies, and only provides an intermittent view of the tumor molecular profile from the initial resection. Liquid biopsy techniques, specifically small extracellular vesicle (sEV) analysis, have the potential to overcome these limitations by providing a window into the brain using peripheral blood. To address the need for monitoring tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance, we developed a GBM biomarker panel (ATP1B2, EAAT2, CD24, CD44, CD133 and EGFR) for multiplexed profiling of sEVs using an advanced GBM Extracellular vesicle Monitoring Phenotypic Analyzer Chip (GEMPAC). We successfully tracked patient response to treatment by monitoring changes in glioma stem cell markers on circulating sEVs. We propose that these results provide a strong rationale for using GBM sEVs as a serial monitoring tool in the future clinical management of GBM patients."

DesignCross-sectional study  ParticipantsParticipants with fundus photographs data and OCT data in the UK Biobank cohort study  MethodsWe used the Retina-based Microvascular Health Assessment System (RMHAS) to extract retinal vascular measurements in the 6*6mm area centered on the macular region. OCT parameters were available from the UK Biobank. First, pairwise correlations between individual retinal layers and vascular parameters were investigated. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was then used to examine associations between sets of variables. Lastly, bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization was employed to investigate potential causal relationships.  Main Outcome MeasuresMeasurements of retinal vascular network and neural layers  ResultsData from 67,918 eyes of 43,029 participants were included. The Ganglion Cell-Inner Plexiform Layer (GC-IPL) thickness showed the strongest correlations with vascular Density and Complexity (r=0.199 for arterial Vessel Area Density and r=0.175 for Number of Segments). The Inner Nuclear Layer (INL) thickness showed positive correlations with Width (r=0.122) and Vessel Area Density (artery) (r=0.127). Mendelian randomization analysis indicated bidirectional causal relationships between retinal vascular features and layer thicknesses. Genetically predicted higher Vessel Density was associated with increased thickness across various retinal layers, with the strongest effect on Inner Segment/Outer Segment + Photoreceptor Segment thickness (standardized effect size 1.50, p<0.001). Genetically predicted increases in retinal layer thicknesses, particularly the Outer Plexiform Layer, were linked to higher Vessel Density (standardized effect size 0.45, p=0.002) and Fractal Dimension (standardized effect size 0.48, p<0.001).  ConclusionsThe positive associations of macular thickness with vascular Density and Caliber measurements were mainly attributable to their associations with GC-IPL and INL. Multidimensional relationships revealed by CCA revealed a complementary nature between the two sets of parameters, highlighting their value as a composite biomarker. Mendelian Randomization uncovered a bidirectional causal relationship that should provide insights into novel therapeutic approaches targeting both vascular and neuronal components."

Carriers of rCNVs with higher gene constraint scores had an increased absolute risk for autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia, but not depression, whereas an increase in PGS for each respective disorder was associated with higher absolute risk across all four disorders. Similarly, elevated absolute risks were observed with the increase of both PGS and gene constraints of rCNVs except in the case of depression. In contrast to some previous case-control studies, our joint analysis of rCNV groups and PGS revealed no indication of significant interactive effect between these two factors on disease risk.

They are often associated with clinical phenotypes, including autosomal dominant diseases driven by haploinsufficiency. Recent analyses using biobanks have suggested that LoF penetrance for some haploinsufficient disorders may be low, an observation that has important implications for population genomic screening. However, biobanks are also rife with missing data, and the reliability of these findings remains uncertain. Here, we examine the penetrance of putative LoFs (pLoFs) using a cohort of {approx}24,000 carriers derived from two population-scale biobanks: the UK Biobank and the All of Us Research Program. We investigate several possible etiologies for reduced pLoF penetrance, including biobank recruitment biases, annotation artifacts, missed diagnoses, and incomplete clinical records. Systematically accounting for these factors increased penetrance, but widespread reduced penetrance remained. Therefore, we hypothesized that other factors must be driving this phenomenon. To test this, we trained machine learning models to identify pLoFs with high penetrance using the genomic features specific to each variant. These models were predictive of penetrance across a range of diseases and pLoF types, including those with prior evidence for pathogenicity. This suggests that reduced pLoF penetrance is in fact common, and care should be taken when counseling asymptomatic carriers."

However, studying the full spectrum of these disorders is hindered by practical limitations on measuring human behavior. This highlights the need for novel technologies that can measure behavioral changes at an intermediate level between diagnosis and genotype. Wearable devices are a promising tool in precision medicine, since they can record physiological measurements over time in response to environmental stimuli and do so at low cost and minimal invasiveness. Here we analyzed wearable and genetic data from a cohort of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. We generated >250 wearable-derived features and used them as intermediate phenotypes in an interpretable AI modeling framework to assign risk scores and classify adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Our model identifies key physiological processes and leverages their temporal patterns to achieve a higher performance than has been previously possible. To investigate how these physiological processes relate to the underlying genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders, we also utilized these intermediate phenotypes in univariate and multivariate GWAS. We identified a total of 29 significant genetic loci and 52 psychiatric-associated genes, including ELFN1 and ADORA3. These results show that wearable-derived continuous features enable a more precise representation of psychiatric disorders and exhibit greater detection power compared to categorical diagnostic labels. In summary, we demonstrate how consumer wearable technology can facilitate dimensional approaches in precision psychiatry and uncover etiological linkages between behavior and genetics."

We decided to reanalyse the dataset with Trial Sequential Analysis to account for statistical heterogeneity and the risk of bias of the historical trials to reassess whether GISSI and ISIS-II were justified or redundant.  MethodsWe extracted data from overviews published in 1982 and 1985 and trial reports on mortality outcomes. For the five largest trials conducted before GISSI and ISIS-II, we also extracted information on the used comparator, randomisation, blinding, dropout proportions, and the use of intention-to-treat analyses. We did random-effects cumulative meta-analyses with Trial Sequential Analysis considering diversity.  ResultsThe largest trials conducted before GISSI and ISIS-II had serious methodological differences and high risks of bias making a cumulative meta-analysis invalid by todays standards of evidence synthesis. The Trial Sequential Analysis showed that the monitoring boundary for a mortality benefit of streptokinase was reached during the ISAM trial. However, both GISSI and ISIS-II were launched before the ISAM trial was published. Focusing only on the cumulative assessment, the megatrials were potentially futile. Sensitivity analyses corroborated these results.  ConclusionOur Trial Sequential Analysis of the historical dataset of streptokinase for myocardial infarction found that conclusive evidence favouring streptokinase was established after the megatrials were launched. However, considering the methodological differences and risks of bias, such cumulative meta-analysis seems invalid. Accordingly, the megatrials were not wasteful."

We have summarized various surgical treatment strategies based on the degree of mitral regurgitation (MR) alongside rhythm control therapy for patients with AFMR and AF.  MethodsThis retrospective study included 145 patients with AF and MR from January 2017 to January 2023. 33 patients with AF and moderate AFMR were designated as the moderate atrial regurgitation (MAR) group. 56 patients with AF and severe AFMR were designated as the severe atrial regurgitation (SAR) group. The remaining 56 patients with AF and severe primary MR were designated as the severe primary regurgitation (SPR) group. All patients in the MAR group underwent thoracoscopic AF procedure via a unilateral approach. Patients in the SAR and SPR groups underwent mitral valvuloplasty plus the Cox Maze IV procedure (CMP IV). Descriptive characteristics and outcomes were analysed.  ResultsTwenty-three patients maintained sinus rhythm (SR) following thoracoscopic AF procedure in the MAR group at average 2.6{+/-}1.1 years follow-up. The degree of regurgitation improved in 26 patients, remained unchanged in 6 patients, and worsened in 1 patient. SR maintenance benefits MR reduction (P<0.0001) compared to the non-SR patients. There was no significant difference in the rate of SR maintenance following mitral valvuloplasty plus CMP IV between SAR (43 patients, 79.6%) and SPR (49 patients, 87.5%) groups. At the last follow-up, echocardiography in the SAR group showed 47 cases with no mitral regurgitation, 4 cases with mild regurgitation, and 1 case with moderate regurgitation. The left atrial diameter in the SAR group remained larger than in the SPR group (P<0.001).  ConclusionsRhythm control therapy is the cornerstone treatment for AFMR patients with AF. Thoracoscopic AF procedure is effective and minimally invasive for moderate AFMR patients with AF. For severe AFMR patients with AF, we recommend CMP IV plus mitral valvuloplasty for safety and effectiveness."

In this study we addressed two current clinical knowledge gaps; (i) are there qualitative or clear distinctions between behavioural profiles in bvFTD and SD, and (ii) what are the precise roles of the prefrontal cortex vs. anterior temporal lobes in supporting social behaviour? Resolving these conundrums is crucial for improving diagnostic accuracy and for the development of targeted interventions to treat challenging behaviours in FTD. Informant questionnaires to assess behavioural changes included the Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised and two targeted measures of apathy and impulsivity. Participants completed a detailed neuropsychological battery to permit investigation of the relationship between cognitive status (including social-semantic knowledge, general semantic processing and executive function) with behaviour change in FTD. To explore changes in regional grey matter volume, a subset of patients had structural MRI. Diagnosis-based group comparisons were supplemented by a transdiagnostic approach which encompassed the spectrum of bvFTD, SD and ""mixed"" or intermediate cases. Such an approach is sensitive to the systematic graded variation in FTD and allows the neurobiological underpinnings of behaviour change to be explored across the entire FTD spectrum. We found a wide range of behavioural changes across FTD. Although quantitatively more severe on average in bvFTD, as expected, the item-level analyses found no evidence for qualitative differences in behavioural profiles or ""behavioural double dissociations"" between bvFTD and SD. Comparisons of self and informant ratings revealed strong discrepancies in the perspective of the caregiver vs. patient. Logistic regression revealed that neuropsychological measures had better discriminative accuracy for bvFTD vs. SD than carer-reported behavioural measures. A principal component analysis of all informant questionnaire domains extracted three components, interpreted as reflecting: (1) apathy, (2) challenging behaviours and (3) activities of daily living. More severe apathy in both FTD subtypes was associated with (a) increased levels of impaired executive function and (b) anterior cingulate cortex atrophy. Questionnaire ratings of impaired behaviour did not correlate with either anterior temporal lobe atrophy or degraded social-semantic knowledge. Together, these findings highlight the presence of a wide range of behavioural changes in both bvFTD and SD, which vary by degree rather than quality. We recommend a transdiagnostic approach for future studies of the neuropsychological and neuroanatomical underpinnings of behavioural deficits in FTD."

MethodsThis study comprised a systematic re-analysis of clinical, electrophysiological, and radiological features. The results of this re-analysis served as independent variables for subsequent statistical analyses of outcome predictors.  ResultsAll children (N = 31) had drug-resistant epilepsy with varying impacts on neurodevelopment and cognition (presurgical intelligence quotient (IQ)/developmental quotient scores: 32-106). Low presurgical IQ was associated with abnormal slow background electroencephalogram (EEG) activity and disrupted sleep architecture. Scalp EEG showed predominantly multiregional and often bilateral epileptiform activity. Advanced epilepsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols identified FCD-specific features in 74.2% of patients (23/31), 17 of whom were initially evaluated as MRI-negative. In six out of eight MRI-negative cases, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and subtraction ictal single-photon emission computed tomography co-registered to MRI (SISCOM) helped localise the dysplastic cortex. Sixteen patients (51.6%) underwent stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG). Twenty-eight underwent resective surgery, and three underwent hemispheral disconnection. Seizure freedom was achieved in 71.0% of patients (22/31) by the last follow-up, including seven of the eight MRI-negative patients. Anti-seizure medications (ASMs) were reduced in 21 patients, with complete withdrawal in 5 individuals. Seizure outcome was predicted by a combination of the following descriptors: age at epilepsy onset, epilepsy duration, long-term invasive EEG, and specific MRI, and PET findings.  SignificanceThis study highlights the broad phenotypic spectrum of FCD type 1, which spans far beyond the narrow descriptions of previous studies. Combining advanced MRI protocols with additional neuroimaging techniques helped localise the epileptogenic zone in many previously non-lesional cases. Complex multimodal presurgical approaches (including SEEG) could enhance postsurgical outcomes in these complex patients.

SNCA, the gene encoding for the protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn), was the first to be associated with familial forms of PD and, since then, several missense variants and multiplications of the SNCA gene have been established as rare causes of autosomal dominant forms of PD.  Aim and methodsA patient carrying aSyn missense mutation and his family members were studied. We present the clinical features, genetic testing - whole exome sequencing (WES), and neuropathological findings. The functional consequences of this aSyn variant were extensively investigated using biochemical, biophysical, and cellular assays.  ResultsThe patient exhibited a complex neurodegenerative disease that included generalized myocloni, bradykinesia, dystonia of the left arm and apraxia. WES identified a novel heterozygous SNCA variant (cDNA 40G>A; protein G14R). Neuropathological examination showed extensive atypical aSyn pathology with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and nigral degeneration pattern with abundant ring-like neuronal inclusions, and few oligodendroglial inclusions. Sanger sequencing confirmed the SNCA variant in the healthy, elderly parent of the patient suggesting incomplete penetrance. NMR studies suggest that the G14R mutation induces a local structural alteration in aSyn, and lower thioflavin T binding in in vitro fibrillization assays. Interestingly, the G14R aSyn fibers display different fibrillar morphologies as revealed by cryo-electron microscopy. Cellular studies of the G14R variant revealed increased inclusion formation, enhanced membrane association, and impaired dynamic reversibility of serine-129 phosphorylation.  SummaryThe atypical neuropathological features observed, which are reminiscent of those observed for the G51D aSyn variant, suggest a causal role of the SNCA variant with a distinct clinical and pathological phenotype, which is further supported by the properties of the mutant aSyn, compatible with the strain hypothesis of proteinopathies."

Brain MRI is an important tool for monitoring disease activity and treatment efficacy in people with MS. Spinal cord (SC) imaging has been less consistently used for monitoring inflammatory disease activity, and the frequency of clinically silent breakthrough disease in the SC is still unknown. Given the particular vulnerability of the cervical spinal cord (c-SC) to inflammatory demyelination, it is important to evaluate the necessity of routine c-SC scanning or to ascertain appropriate strategies for its monitoring, considering the burden of each scan on a person with MS, including scanner discomfort and cost.  ObjectiveTo determine how frequently follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spinal cord (c-SC) in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) reveals asymptomatic T2 hyperintense lesions, either in combination or in the absence of new MRI brain lesions, and to identify potential associated risk factors for developing such lesions.  MethodsPatients aged 18-65 years who were diagnosed with RRMS and were seen in longitudinal follow-up at the Johns Hopkins MS Center from January 1, 2014, to December 1, 2019, with an MRI brain and C spine performed during that period, were included. The results of up to four c-SC scans were considered during this study period. Asymptomatic new lesions were identified as new hyperintense T2 lesions, with or without enhancement, observed on MRI during routine follow-up surveillance. Univariate and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression (sex at birth, age, race, and current disease modifying therapy [DMT] category) were employed to identify factors associated with the development of an asymptomatic c-SC lesion for the first scan. Additionally, a mixed-effects logistic regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with developing asymptomatic lesions across successive scans.  ResultsA total of 869 individuals were included in the cohort, contributing a median of 3 (interquartile range: 2,4) scans per person. The proportion of incidental asymptomatic lesions identified ranged from 4.8 to 12.1% across the four scans analyzed in the study. Among those with new lesions in the c-SC, roughly half also showed concomitant new activity on brain MRI. The multivariate model was notable for Black/African Americans having higher odds of an asymptomatic new lesion (OR= 3.26, 95% CI 0.79, 5.93, p<0.0001), a result that persisted in mixed effects logistic regression models (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.27, 2.35, p = 0.001). Higher-efficacy therapies were associated with higher odds of detection of a new lesion in the mixed-effects model, an association that was not present when considering just the first scan results as the outcome.  ConclusionWhile the association of higher-efficacy therapy is presumed to be related to confounding by indication, Black/African American individuals with MS appear to be at higher risk of developing an asymptomatic c-SC lesion on MRI surveillance, which could suggest higher value of ordering asymptomatic screening imaging of the cord in this subpopulation. Ultimately, however, a very small percentage of the overall population of those with MS has a new cord lesion in the absence of symptoms, and half of those have a new lesion on screening brain MRI. These findings should motivate the creation and validation of predictive models to inform the utility cord imaging at a given timepoint for a given individual with MS, which could enhance healthcare quality and reduce costs."

In this study, we performed transcriptome wide profiling of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modifications across IDH mutant (n = 8) and wild-type (n = 7) gliomas using Oxford Nanopore Technologies direct RNA sequencing platform. Our approach enabled high-depth coverage of native transcripts, revealing nearly twice as many full-length transcripts in IDH mutant gliomas compared to wild-type. Notable differences in alternative splicing were observed across glioma subtypes, with truncated and non-coding isoforms more prevalent in glioblastoma (GBM). We further identified significant changes in isoform usage within key metabolic (NAMPT, PKM) and immune (CD63, CD151, CD81) pathways. Chromosomal distribution of m6A sites showed a higher prevalence of m6A modifications in IDH mutant gliomas, with the most pronounced differences on chromosomes 19 and 16. Further stratification by TERT, MGMT, and TP53 mutations revealed similar patterns of increased m6A site numbers in mutant groups, highlighting the importance of integrating epigenomic and epitranscriptomic data in glioma research. These findings highlight the role of m6A modifications in the metabolic reprogramming unique to IDH mutant gliomas, providing insights into potential mechanisms of tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance."

MethodsAs part of the population-based Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivors Study, we sent questionnaires inquiring about dental problems to survivors aged 5-19 years and their siblings. We retrieved cancer-relevant information from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry and used logistic regressions to compare dental problems between survivors and siblings and to investigate cancer-related risk factors.  ResultsWe included 735 survivors and 144 siblings. Almost half of survivors and siblings reported at least one dental problem. Compared to siblings, survivors had a greater risk for hypo- or microdontia (OR 1.7; 95%CI 0.9-3.2) and enamel hypoplasia (2.2; 0.8-6.0), but similar risk for cavities or cavity-related tooth loss (0.8; 0.6-1.3).

This represents the first such comparison and provides new insight into OCTs capabilities, strengths and limitations.  ObjectiveTo qualitatively compare the capabilities of middle ear OCT to CT in normal and pathological ears on representative slices in co-registered OCT and CT datasets.  Design, Setting, and ParticipantsOne normal middle ear, one ear affected by traumatic injury and one ear with cholesteatoma were imaged with both OCT and high-resolution clinical temporal bone CT. Participants were drawn from the patient population of a tertiary otology clinic. CT and OCT images were aligned using rigid co-registration with manual landmark selection.  Main Outcomes and MeasuresImages were analyzed qualitatively for field of view, resolution, shadowing, artefacts, soft tissue and bony tissue contrast and presentation of diagnostically important features.  ResultsIn the three imaged ears, OCT was capable of visualizing many of the important features indicative of middle ear pathology. When compared to CT, OCT was found to exhibit a limited field of view (FOV) largely confined to the mesotympanum and subject to shadowing from bony structures. However, OCT could resolve soft tissue features that were not readily apparent in the CT images, to have a higher resolution than CT and to provide excellent anatomical fidelity with CT which allowed OCT images to be accurately co-registered with CT images.  Conclusions and RelevanceThe results support a role for middle ear OCT in otological diagnostics. While OCT is not capable of replacing CT due to its limited FOV and inability to image through thick bony tissues, it can visualize many signs of pathology including some soft tissue features that are difficult to visualize with CT. Given OCTs ability to image in real-time, its compatibility with in-office imaging and its lack of ionizing radiation, it may, despite its limitations compared to CT, be an appealing imaging modality for many applications in middle ear diagnostics.

MethodsAn international multicenter study was designed, building a deep phenotyped cohort of HTx recipients recruited between 2011 and 2021 at 4 referral centers. Detailed donors, recipients, clinical, immunological, biological, and histological parameters were collected. EMBs were graded according to international working formulations. Tissue gene expression was analyzed on FFPE-EMB using the consensus Banff Human Organ Transplant gene set. Molecular classifiers of antibody-mediated (AMR) and acute cellular rejection (ACR) were built. Discrimination and calibration were assessed in the development and validation sets (NCT06436027).  ResultsA total of 591 biopsies were included: 188 AMR (pAMR1(I+): n=51; pAMR1(H+): n=58; pAMR2-3: n=79), 289 ACR (1R n=174; 2-3R n=115) and 114 matched non-rejection cases. Biopsies were split in a derivation (n=476) and a validation set (n=115). AMR top significant transcripts were related to the IFN-gamma inducible pathway, endothelial activation, and monocyte-macrophage recruitment. ACR was characterized by transcripts related to T-cell receptor, CD3 receptor activation, and CD28 signaling.

ObjectiveWe sought to develop a rapid, non-invasive method for obtaining and analyzing epidermal protein biomarkers from skin and utilize this methodology to dissect immunologic heterogeneity in both psoriasis and eczematous dermatitis.  MethodsWe optimize and evaluate detergent-based immune profiling system (DIPS) which utilizes a combination of two detergents to solubilize full-thickness epidermis when applied to the skin with an applicator. Downstream proteomic profiling of this material allows high-throughput immunologic characterization of immune biomarkers.  ResultsDIPS was performed on 43 patients with psoriasis and 27 patients with eczematous dermatitis. This approach was found to be painless, nonscarring, and enabled rapid turnaround from sample collection to data output. We used this approach to accurately differentiate psoriasis and eczema using a limited set of proteins and to identify cases of eczema/psoriasis overlap with non-canonical molecular profiles. Additionally, we measured patient-specific cytokine profiles in eczema that correlated with response to IL-4R blockade.

Moss', 'Morteza Mahmoudi']",Morteza Mahmoudi (mosss@wfu.edu),"['1 Wake Forest University', '2 Michigan State University']","Academic bullying is a pervasive and longstanding issue that negatively affects all fields of science. While influential factors such as scientific discipline, sex, and ethnicity have been investigated, the impact of perpetrators age on the contextual behaviors of academic bullying has not been thoroughly studied. Our cross-sectional global survey of academic bullying, involving 2,390 participants, provides evidence that age significantly influences the contextual behaviors of academic bullying. Our results revealed that the youngest perpetrators (aged 25-35) exhibit significantly less abusive behavior compared to other age categories (36 and older). Additionally, the lowest percentage of abusive behavior was observed in the youngest group, while the highest was found in the older groups (aged 56-65). Our comprehensive analysis on the potential influence of the perpetrators academic position, ethnicity, or sex on their age group revealed no significant impact. These findings have strong implications for the development of more customized academic bullying training, policy development, and monitoring strategies, ultimately benefiting the scientific community at large in many aspects including evolution of science and improving the mental health of the academic workforce."

A recent trial comparing the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine versus placebo in surgical patients, some of whom were on chronic opioid therapy, revealed a substantial placebo effect. This finding provided an opportunity to test the hypothesis that opioid agonist exposure interacts with placebo antidepressant responses.  MethodsThis post hoc analysis utilized data from a previously reported randomized, anesthesia-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of intravenous ketamine in depressed patients undergoing routine surgery. Mixed-effects models were used to determine whether baseline opioid use influenced antidepressant responses to the trial interventions, as measured by the Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) over 1 to 14 days post-treatment.  ResultsThe analysis showed that baseline opioid use significantly reduced post-treatment depression severity in patients who received placebo, but not in those who received ketamine. This reduction was independent of baseline depression severity, baseline pain intensity, and ethnicity. Additionally, there was negligible correlation between postoperative pain intensity and depression severity.  LimitationsThis analysis was unregistered and conducted on a small sample; the findings need to be confirmed by prospective controlled studies.  ConclusionsOpioid use at baseline attenuated the placebo antidepressant response independently of pain in depressed patients who received the study treatment under general anesthesia for routine surgery.

Study designSystematic review of randomised controlled trials.  MethodsSystematic searches were performed in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC and PSYNDEX from inception to May 2023 to identify evaluation studies of EBHI and DAs that take into account factors associated with unequal opportunities as defined by PROGRESS Plus. Information on the effect of these factors was extracted and analysed in terms of outcomes relevant to the decision-making process.  ResultsFew studies have examined the impact of EBHI/DAs on outcomes relevant to decision-making with respect to inequity-producing factors. In our final synthesis,12 studies were included. A positive association between the effectiveness of the intervention and the disadvantage status could be found twice and a negative association in three studies. Overall, most of the studies found no difference in knowledge gain, decision conflict and shared decision-making (SDM) between those advantaged and disadvantaged in terms of ethnicity, gender, education, age, income, health literacy, numeracy or socioeconomic status (SES). However, few trials examined this effect and the effect was considered solely in subgroup analyses that were probably underpowered, so asymmetries between these groups may not have been detected in the existing designs.  ConclusionEBHI and DAs have been shown to be effective in promoting decision-making and thus in improving health care.

This study uses the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) test to explore their psychological traits. The study aims to identify the unique personality profiles of multi-marathoners and understand their implications for participation, performance, and well-being.  MethodsTIPI was used to describe personality and provide valuable insights into the tendencies for certain personality traits. TIPI was conducted via an online cross-sectional survey distributed to the multi-marathon community, which received 593 responses, 56% men (n=331, average age = 53.87 years, SD = 9.91), 44% women (n=261, average age = 54.06, SD 10.56) from 22 countries. One respondent identified as another gender and was not included in the gender-based analysis. Cronbachs Alpha and Guttmans Lambda 6 were calculated to assess the internal consistency of the survey, and the results were statistically analysed using Mann-Whitney U tests, ANOVA Aligned Rank Transform (ART) tests, and Wilcoxon rank- sum post-hoc tests to highlight differences in emotional stability, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and agreeableness. Normative TIPI data from the original TIPI study served as a dataset for comparison. Additionally, Spearmans {rho} based correlation was used to explore relationships between personality traits and other related variables from the multi-marathoner community collected from a previous study.  ResultsThe findings reveal distinctive personality traits among multi-marathoners. Compared to the general population, results show multi-marathoners displayed higher levels of conscientiousness (F (1,591) = 2.42, p < 0.001 for gender), indicating strong self-discipline, organisation, and goal-oriented behaviour. They exhibited lower levels of emotional stability (F (1,591) = 5.525, p < 0.001 for age group) and openness (F (1,591) = 2.54, p < 0.001 for age group), suggesting challenges in stress management and adaptability. Following significant results from the ANOVA ART tests, the Wilcoxon rank-sum post-hoc analysis revealed a significant gender difference in agreeableness, with women exhibiting higher levels of agreeableness compared to men (W = 50809, p<0.00091). However, after applying the Bonferroni statistical correction, no significant differences were found between genders in conscientiousness or emotional stability. Additionally, there were no significant differences in personality traits across different age groups after applying the statistical correction. These findings suggest that while gender differences in agreeableness are robust, age-related differences in personality traits were not statistically significant in this study.  ConclusionThis study offers insights into the psychological traits of multi-marathoners, highlighting their high conscientiousness and lower emotional stability. Contrary to the initial hypotheses, no significant differences were found in openness, and age-related differences in personality traits were not statistically significant after applying the Bonferroni statistical correction. These findings suggest that while multi-marathoners possess distinct personality traits, the relationship between these traits and their engagement in endurance sports is more complex than initially anticipated. These insights can guide the development of interventions to foster resilience and sustained participation, enhancing their overall experience and success in multi-marathoning. Longitudinal studies to track changes in personality traits and explore effective psychological interventions for this unique athletic community would allow further insight."

Glioblastoma Multiforme is the most common type of malignant tumor found in the brain and is extremely aggressive. For this reason, advanced detection of malignant brain tumors is necessary for optimal mitigation. Conversely, the classification of tumors during Medical Resonance Imaging can be difficult due to bodily movements resulting in the movement of the tumor. The movement of the tumor can disrupt targeted radiotherapy and can also, at times, result in treatments about radiotherapy damaging healthy areas of the brain rather than areas of the tumor. This study proposes a novel deep learning system that can identify tumors from MRI images; which can be helpful for the case of early detection, as well as being able to track tumors during active imaging; resulting in higher efficiency with targeted radiotherapy. This is done utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) created via deep learning frameworks. With the image identification of tumors; 97% accuracy was achieved with optimization. The tumor-classification deep learning system achieved an accuracy of 98%. Further testing is required for optimization; with this optimization, higher accuracy can be reached."

Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. It typically manifests itself initially with cognitive impairment in the memory domain, and gradually progresses towards affecting all activities of daily living. Active music interventions, particularly singing, may improve mood, social behaviour, and quality of life. However, little is known about their effects on cognition, although some studies have provided promising results. The M4M project aims to fill this gap in research by measuring the effects of learning new songs on cognitive functioning. Specifically, M4M will examine memory for new songs in non-musician adults with AD after undergoing intensive versus minimal individual musical training based on singing novel songs.  Methods and analysisHome-dwelling adults with AD, 65 years or older, will receive 5 months of intensive intervention (2x/week) and 5 months of minimal intervention (1x/month). In a crossover design, participants will be randomized to receive either the intensive or minimal intervention first, with 2 months between the intervention periods. Participants will receive individual music lessons to learn new songs, provided by a music instructor with adequate training. The main outcomes will be measured at the beginning and end of each intervention period. General cognition will be measured with the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive (ADAS-cog) by an assessor blinded to the randomisation. Participants memory for music will be measured using the N400 component of electroencephalographic event-related potentials in response to music stimuli. Additional outcomes evaluated during intervention sessions include mood and musical performance observations. With 113 participants randomised, the trial will have 80% power to detect clinically meaningful effects. Relations between mood, memory for music, and cognitive abilities will be examined, with sex, age, AD stage, previous musical training, and education as covariates. M4M will be conducted in close collaboration between academic researchers, service providers, and service users to ensure relevance and applicability.  Ethics and disseminationDissemination of findings will apply to local, national, and international levels. The study has been approved by the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway.  Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06611878.  Strength and limitations- Based on recent data suggesting that individuals with advanced dementia can learn new songs, our study moves beyond reminiscence-based therapy since the participants will be actively involved in musical training based on singing to learn novel songs - The study focuses on home-dwelling older adults with dementia. This is becoming more and more important, as interventions that can prolong the period of independent living outside care facilities are urgently needed - By using EEG technology that is portable, inexpensive, non-invasive, less demanding for participants than other brain imaging examinations, performed in a naturalistic setting, this study will reach people who are less mobile or live in remote areas, thus improving generalisability. - As a multinational trial conducted in urban and rural settings in high- and middle-income countries, results will be relevant across diverse societies. - Due to the nature of the intervention, participants cannot be blinded."

To uncover clinically translatable mechanisms of psychopathology, it is critical to define how the spatial organization of these networks relates to genetic risk during development.  ObjectiveTo determine the relationship between transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence.  DesignThe Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) StudySM is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of 21 collection sites across the United States. Here, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis of ABCD baseline data, collected 2017-2018.  SettingThe ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site community-based study.  ParticipantsThe sample is largely recruited through school systems. Exclusion criteria included severe sensory, intellectual, medical, or neurological issues that interfere with protocol and scanner contraindications. Split-half subsets were used for cross-validation, matched on age, ethnicity, family structure, handedness, parental education, site, sex, and anesthesia exposure.  ExposuresPolygenic risk scores of transdiagnostic genetic factors F1 (PRS-F1) and F2 (PRS-F2) derived from adults in Psychiatric Genomic Consortium and UK Biobanks datasets. PRS-F1 indexes liability for common psychiatric symptoms and disorders related to mood disturbance; PRS-F2 indexes liability for rarer forms of mental illness characterized by mania and psychosis.  Main Outcomes and Measures(1) P-factor derived from bifactor models of youth- and parent-reported mental health assessments. (2) Person-specific functional brain network topography derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans.  ResultsTotal participants included 11,873 youths ages 9-10 years old; 5,678 (47.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 9.92 (0.62) years. PFN topography was found to be heritable (N=7,459, 57.06% of vertices h2 pFDR<0.05, mean h2=0.35). PRS-F1 was associated with p-factor (N=5,815, r=0.12, 95% CI [0.09-0.15], p<0.001). Interindividual differences in functional network topography were associated with p-factor (N=7,459, mean r=0.12), PRS-F1 (N=3,982, mean r=0.05), and PRS-F2 (N=3,982, mean r=0.08). Cortical maps of p-factor and PRS-F1 regression coefficients were highly correlated (r=0.7, p=0.003).  Conclusions and RelevancePolygenic risk for transdiagnostic adulthood psychopathology is associated with both p-factor and heritable PFN topography during early adolescence. These results advance our understanding of the developmental drivers of psychopathology.  Key PointsQuestion: What is the relationship between transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence?  Findings: In this cross-sectional analysis of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) StudySM (N=11,873, ages 9-10), we found that a PRS of common psychopathology in adulthood (PRS-F1) was associated with p-factor during early adolescence. Interindividual differences in p-factor, PRS-F1, and PRS-F2 (capturing rarer psychopathology in adulthood) were all robustly associated with PFN topography.  Meaning: Polygenic risk for transdiagnostic adulthood psychopathology is associated with both p-factor and PFN topography during early adolescence."

To uncover clinically translatable mechanisms of psychopathology, it is critical to define how the spatial organization of these networks relates to genetic risk during development.  ObjectiveTo determine the relationship between transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence.  DesignThe Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) StudySM is an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of 21 collection sites across the United States. Here, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis of ABCD baseline data, collected 2017-2018.  SettingThe ABCD Study(R) is a multi-site community-based study.  ParticipantsThe sample is largely recruited through school systems. Exclusion criteria included severe sensory, intellectual, medical, or neurological issues that interfere with protocol and scanner contraindications. Split-half subsets were used for cross-validation, matched on age, ethnicity, family structure, handedness, parental education, site, sex, and anesthesia exposure.  ExposuresPolygenic risk scores of transdiagnostic genetic factors F1 (PRS-F1) and F2 (PRS-F2) derived from adults in Psychiatric Genomic Consortium and UK Biobanks datasets. PRS-F1 indexes liability for common psychiatric symptoms and disorders related to mood disturbance; PRS-F2 indexes liability for rarer forms of mental illness characterized by mania and psychosis.  Main Outcomes and Measures(1) P-factor derived from bifactor models of youth- and parent-reported mental health assessments. (2) Person-specific functional brain network topography derived from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans.  ResultsTotal participants included 11,873 youths ages 9-10 years old; 5,678 (47.8%) were female, and the mean (SD) age was 9.92 (0.62) years. PFN topography was found to be heritable (N=7,459, 57.06% of vertices h2 pFDR<0.05, mean h2=0.35). PRS-F1 was associated with p-factor (N=5,815, r=0.12, 95% CI [0.09-0.15], p<0.001). Interindividual differences in functional network topography were associated with p-factor (N=7,459, mean r=0.12), PRS-F1 (N=3,982, mean r=0.05), and PRS-F2 (N=3,982, mean r=0.08). Cortical maps of p-factor and PRS-F1 regression coefficients were highly correlated (r=0.7, p=0.003).  Conclusions and RelevancePolygenic risk for transdiagnostic adulthood psychopathology is associated with both p-factor and heritable PFN topography during early adolescence. These results advance our understanding of the developmental drivers of psychopathology.  Key PointsQuestion: What is the relationship between transdiagnostic polygenic risk scores (PRSs), personalized functional brain networks (PFNs), and overall psychopathology (p-factor) during early adolescence?  Findings: In this cross-sectional analysis of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) StudySM (N=11,873, ages 9-10), we found that a PRS of common psychopathology in adulthood (PRS-F1) was associated with p-factor during early adolescence. Interindividual differences in p-factor, PRS-F1, and PRS-F2 (capturing rarer psychopathology in adulthood) were all robustly associated with PFN topography.  Meaning: Polygenic risk for transdiagnostic adulthood psychopathology is associated with both p-factor and PFN topography during early adolescence."

Negative client-provider interactions remain a major reason for TI and barrier for return to care, especially for men. Motivational interviewing (MI) facilitates client-driven counseling and improves client-provider interactions by facilitating equitable, interactive counseling that helps clients understand and develop solutions for their unique needs. Fidelity of MI counseling in resource-constrained health systems is challenging.  MethodsWe developed a male-specific MI curriculum for Malawian male TI clients. Four psychosocial counselors (PCs, a high-level Malawian counseling cadre) received a 2.5-day curriculum training and job-aid to guide MI counseling approaches. They participated in monthly phone-based discussions with their manager about MI-based solutions to challenges faced. PCs implemented the MI curriculum with men >15 years who were actively experiencing TI. Clients were found at home (through tracing) or at the facility (for those who returned to care on their own). MI counseling sessions were recorded, transcribed, translated into English, and coded in Atlas.ti v9. MI quality was assessed using a modified version of the validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity tool. The tool has two measures: 1) counts of key MI behaviors throughout the session (questions, reflections, etc.); and 2) overarching scores (using a five-point scale) that characterize three MI dimensions for an entire counseling session (cultivating change talk, partnership, and empathy).  Results44 MI sessions were recorded and analyzed between 4/1/22-8/1/22. 64% of counseling sessions focused on work and travel as the main reason for TI. 86% of sessions yielded client-driven, tailored solutions for overcoming TI. PCs implemented multiple MI behaviors very well: asking questions, giving information, simple reflections, and client affirmation. Few PCs used complex reflection, emphasized autonomy, or sought collaboration with clients. Among overarching MI dimensions, HCWs scored high in partnership (promoting client-driven discussions) and cultivating change talk (encouraging client-driven language and behavior change confidence) but scored sub-optimal in empathy. Only 5 sessions had confrontational/negative PC attitudes.  ConclusionsPCs implemented MI with fidelity and quality resulting in tailored, actionable plans for male re-engagement in HIV treatment in Malawi.  Clinical Trial NumberNCT05137210 and NCT04858243"

To counter this bias, we apply a propensity-weighted analysis of the first two years of The Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study(R) data, employing a machine learning analysis weighted by individuals propensity to experience adversity. Data included 338 resting-state functional connections from 7190 youth (46% female), divided into a training group (80%) and an independent testing group (20%). Propensity scores were computed using 390 variables to balance across two-year adverse life event exposures. Using elastic net regularization with and without inverse propensity weighting, we developed linear models in which changes in functional connectivity of brain connections during the two-year period served as predictors of the number of adverse events experienced during that same period. Haufes method was applied to forward-transform the backward prediction models. We also tested whether brain changes associated with adverse events correlated with concomitant changes in internalizing or externalizing behaviors or to academic achievement. In the propensity-weighted analysis, brain development significantly predicted the number of adverse events experienced during that period in both the training group ({rho}=0.14, p<0.001) and the independent testing group ({rho}=0.10, p<0.001). The predictor indicated a general pattern of decreased functional connectivity between large-scale networks and subcortical brain regions, particularly for cingulo-opercular and sensorimotor networks. These network-to-subcortical functional connectivity decreases inversely associated with the development of internalizing symptoms, suggesting adverse events promoted adaptive brain changes that may buffer against stress-related psychopathology. However, these same functional connections were also associated with poorer grades at the two-year follow-up. Although cortical-subcortical brain developmental responses to adversity potentially shield against stress-induced mood and anxiety disorders, they may be detrimental to other domains such as academic success."

METHODSIn this cross-sectional study fourteen asymptomatic APP-dup carriers and eight APP-dup non-carriers from the same kindred underwent neurological and neuropsychological examination and resting-state fMRI scanning. The functional connectome of each participant was constructed based on 264 pre-defined brain regions, which were classified into seven different sensory (Visual and Somatomotor) and association (Default, Frontoparietal, Ventral Attention, Dorsal Attention, Limbic) cortical networks.

RESULTSComparing individual connectomes within the carriers group to the average connectome in the non-carrier group, we found that network similarity between groups decreased in an age-dependent manner. With age the APP-dup connectome diverged from the non-carriers connectome, with this difference being driven primarily by alterations in association networks and specifically involving the Default and Frontoparietal networks. Moreover, decreases in network similarity of association networks correlated with decreased performance on a visuospatial memory task. Using CPM, we found that in this family, carriers age can be predicted independent of the non-carriers control group and that this prediction is based mainly on connections within and between association networks.

However, further validation is needed to establish the H patterns effectiveness as a biomarker for measuring the EZ.  MethodsWe retrospectively enrolled 131 patients diagnosed with drug-resistant focal epilepsy, all of whom had complete stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) data. From this cohort, we selected 85 patients for outcome analysis. We analyzed the morphological and time-frequency (TF) features of the H pattern using TF plots. A third quartile (Q3) threshold was applied to classify channels expressing either dominant (ChanneldH pattern) or non-dominant H patterns (Channelnon-dH pattern). We then examined associations between the morphological features of the H pattern and patients clinical characteristics, as well as the correlations between the extent of channel removal and seizure outcomes.  ResultsWe found no significant correlations between the morphological features of the ictal H pattern and clinical factors, including lesional MRI findings, epileptic onset patterns, epilepsy type, pathology, or surgical outcomes. The non-localizable H pattern appeared exclusively in patients with non-focal onset patterns. Notably, the proportion of ChanneldH pattern was higher in the seizure-onset zone (SOZ) compared to the early propagation zone. The seizure-free group demonstrated significantly higher removal proportions of ChanneldH pattern, both within and outside the SOZ (p = 0.014; p = 0.036), with AUCs of 0.606 and 0.660, respectively, in a seizure freedom prediction model. Survival analysis confirmed that complete removal of these regions correlated with long-term seizure freedom (p = 0.008; p = 0.028). Further subgroup analysis showed a significant correlation in neocortical epilepsy (p = 0.0004; p = 0.011), but not in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, multivariate analysis identified the complete removal of ChanneldH pattern as the only independent predictor for seizure freedom (p = 0.022; OR 6.035, 95% CI 1.291-28.211).  ConclusionsOur study supports the notion that the dominance of the ictal H pattern, regardless of its morphology, serves as a novel biomarker for the EZ in focal epilepsy. The non-linearity in EEG waveforms provides new insights into understanding ictal spreading propagation and offers potential improvements for surgical planning in neocortical epilepsy."

Although the availability of genomic data has sharply increased in recent years, the accessibility of bioinformatic tools to aid in its preparation is still lacking. Limitations with processing genomic data primarily include its large volume, associated computational and storage costs, and difficulty in identifying targeted and relevant information. Here, we present VAREANT, an accessible and configurable bioinformatic tool to support the preparation of variant data into a usable analysis-ready format. Designed to simplify the data pre-processing workflow, VAREANT enables the curation of targeted variant datasets. VAREANT is comprised of three standalone modules: (1) Pre- processing, (2) Variant Annotation, (3) Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) Data Preparation. Pre-processing supports the fine-grained filtering of complex variant datasets to eliminate extraneous data. Variant Annotation allows for the addition of variant metadata from public annotation databases for subsequent analysis and interpretation. AI/ML Data Preparation supports the user in creating AI/ML-ready datasets suitable for immediate analysis with minimal pre-processing required. We have successfully tested and validated our tool on numerous variable-sized datasets and implemented VAREANT in two case studies involving patients with CVDs. Efficiently extracting relevant variants into an AI/ML ready format using tools like VAREANT has important scientific implications, such as producing targeted and high-quality datasets and helping reduce overall computational costs."

However, there is limited best practice evidence for reporting PRS and patient-friendly reports for communicating effectively PRS are lacking. Here we developed patient-centred PRS reports for glaucoma screening based on the literature and evaluated them with participants using a qualitative research approach.  MethodsWe first reviewed existing PRS reports and literature on probabilistic risk communication. This informed the development of a draft glaucoma screening PRS report for a hypothetical high risk individual from the general population. We designed three versions of the report to illustrate risk using a pictograph, a pie chart and a bell curve. We then conducted semi-structured interviews to assess preference of visual risk communication aids, understanding of risk, content, format and structure of the reports. Participants were invited from an existing study, which aims to evaluate the clinical validity of glaucoma among individuals >50 years from the general population. Numeracy and literacy levels were assessed.  ResultsWe interviewed 12 individuals (50% female, 42% university education). Numeracy (mean 2.1{+/-}0.9, range 0-3), graph literacy (mean 2.8{+/-}0.8, range 0-4) and genetic literacy (mean 24.2{+/-}6.2, range -20-+46) showed a range of levels. We analysed the reports under three main themes: visual preferences, understanding risk and reports formatting. The visual component was deemed important to understanding risk, with the pictograph being the preferred visual risk representation, followed by the pie chart and the bell curve. Participants expressed preference for absolute risk in understanding risk, along with the written content explaining the results. The importance of follow-up recommendations and time to glaucoma onset were highlighted. Participants expressed varied opinions in the level of information and the colours used, which informed revisions of the report.  ConclusionsOur study revealed preferences for reporting PRS information in the context of glaucoma screening, to support the development of clinical PRS reporting. Further research is needed to assess PRS communication in other contexts and with other target audiences (e.g. referring clinicians), and its potential psychosocial impact in the wider community."

CKD patients face an increased risk of progressing to end-stage kidney failure (ESKF), which is associated with higher hospitalization rates and cardiovascular mortality. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a key indicator of kidney function and a critical predictor of CKD progression. However, existing predictive models often fail to incorporate the dynamic changes in eGFR over time, leading to less accurate forecasts of disease progression. In this study, we develop a novel deep learning model, the time-dependent LSTM (TdLSTM), to improve the prediction of eGFR and time-to-ESKF by effectively handling time-varying variables and irregular measurement time intervals in longitudinal study. Our method captures the evolving patterns of CKD progression, enabling more accurate predictions of patient outcomes. The specifically designed survival time estimate approach yields accurate predictions of the time of reaching the end stage of the disease. We trained and validated the TdLSTM model using data from two cohorts of CKD patients, demonstrating its superiority over existing models in predicting CKD progression and identifying distinct patient subtypes with varying progression rates. The proposed TdLSTM model enhances our ability to predict CKD outcomes by integrating temporal information into the predictive process, ultimately generating better prediction accuracy on the redefined time-varying evaluation metrics such as AUC and concordance index."

It is unknown whether autonomic neuropathy (AN) may contribute to these mechanisms by altering gastrointestinal motility.  MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study of 100 PWH and 89 controls. All participants underwent assessment of gastrointestinal transit times using a wireless motility capsule (WMC). All PWH and a subset of controls also underwent: a standardized battery of autonomic function tests summarized as the Modified Composite Autonomic Severity Score (MCASS) and its adrenergic, cardiovagal and sudomotor sub-scores, breath testing for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Disorders Symptoms (PAGI-SYM) and Composite Autonomic Symptom Score 31 (COMPASS-31) questionnaires.  ResultsPWH displayed shorter gastric emptying times (GET) and longer small bowel and colonic transit times (SBTT, CTT) compared to controls. Among PWH, GET was associated with PAGI-SYM score. The MCASS and its sudomotor sub-score (reflecting peripheral sympathetic function) were associated with SBTT but not GET or CTT. PWH with prolonged SBTT (>6h) were more likely to have SIBO.  ConclusionGastrointestinal motility is altered in PWH. This study provides preliminary evidence that changes in autonomic function may influence SBTT in PWH and that prolonged SBTT may contribute to the development of SIBO. Future studies are needed to more fully elucidate the pathophysiologic links between HIV-associated AN, altered gastrointestinal motility, the gastrointestinal microbiome, chronic inflammation, and resulting morbidity and mortality among PWH."

Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed the treatment landscape for HIV, it is frequently associated with adverse effects, including anemia, hepatotoxicity, and immune-related issues such as Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS), particularly in patients co-infected with tuberculosis (TB).  Materials and methodsIn this prospective cohort study, 400 ART-naive, HIV-positive patients undergoing anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) at King Georges Medical University, Lucknow, India, were enrolled. The study evaluated the occurrence of opportunistic infections (OIs), ART regimen effectiveness, and key laboratory markers, including CD4 counts and hemoglobin levels.  ResultsTB emerged as the most common OI, affecting 20.25% of the participants, with anemia present in 85% of the cohort. The prevalence of IRIS was notably higher in patients with a positive tuberculin skin test (20.6%) compared to those with a negative test (7.4%). Patients with IRIS exhibited significantly lower CD4 counts and hemoglobin levels compared to those without IRIS.  ConclusionThis study underscores the importance of integrated management approaches for HIV patients co-infected with TB, focusing on the complex interaction between immune status, ART effectiveness, and comorbidities like anemia and hepatotoxicity. Properly addressing these factors is crucial for improving patient outcomes in this high-risk population."

Despite the growing use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for {beta}-lactams, clear toxicity thresholds remain undefined, leaving clinicians uncertain about dosing adjustments when adverse effects occur. Identifying a relevant and easily detectable neurophysiological biomarker for {beta}-lactam exposure would improve monitoring and prevent serious complications.  MethodsIn a prospective multicenter, non-interventional study, we analysed electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of 56 patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) receiving continuous infusions of five {beta}-lactams (meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, cefotaxime, or ceftazidime). We applied a time frequency decomposition on these EEG data to investigate quantitatively the power of neural dynamics across frequencies ranging from 1 to 45 Hz. We used a multivariate pattern decoding method to correlate the {beta}-lactam exposure and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores with the neural activity.  Results{beta}-lactam exposure correlated with increased {beta}-low {gamma} neural dynamics (20-40 Hz) (p < 0.001, FDR corrected), independent of other clinical factors or medications. B neural activity was most pronounced in central electrodes (C3 : r = 0.20, p < 0.01; C4 : r = 0.26, p < 0.01) and the right frontal electrode (Fp2 : r = 0.12, p = 0.02). Lower {theta}- activity (3.5-5 Hz and 12-18 Hz) was associated with higher SOFA scores (p < 0.001, FDR corrected). No significant correlations were observed between other drugs (opioids, antiseizure medications, psychotropics) and {beta} or {theta}- dynamics.  ConclusionsThese results suggest that {beta} neural dynamics represent a potential biomarker for {beta}-lactam exposure in ICU patients. They highlight the potential of quantitative EEG and advanced multivariate decoding methods to identify subtle neurophysiological features that are otherwise difficult to detect.

However, our understanding of clinical characteristics that predispose patients to worse outcomes, such as concurrent sudden cardiac arrest (CA), remains limited.  ObjectiveWe performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies assessing clinical outcomes among SCAD patients with aconcurrent CA.  MethodsThis study was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus were systematically searched using relevant search terms, such as ""Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection"", ""Ventricular Tachycardia"", ""Ventricular Fibrillation"", ""Sudden Cardiac Death"" and ""Cardiac Arrest"". The search was conducted from database inception to July 2024. Studies assessing the clinical outcomes of SCAD patients with concurrent CA were included. RevMan 5.4 was used for meta-analysis.  ResultsAfter removal of duplicates, 269 studies underwent screening, out of which 10 studies were included (n= 3978 patients, 357 with CA). In-hospital mortality, post-discharge mortality, recurrent MI and recurrent SCAD occurred in 20%, 3%, 12% and 9% of SCAD patients with CA, respectively. When compared to SCAD patients without CA, SCAD patients with CA were at significantly higher risk of in-hospital mortality (RR = 6.75, 95% CI [4.50, 10.14], I2= 0%), post-discharge mortality (RR = 5.86, 95% CI [1.72, 19.91], I2=0%), recurrent MI (RR =3.31, 95% CI [2.03, 5.39], I2=56%), recurrent SCAD (RR = 1.91, 95% CI [1.11, 3.27], I2= 43%), acute heart failure (RR = 4.82, 95% CI [3.22, 7.20], I2=42%), and cardiogenic shock (RR = 6.11, 95% CI [4.07, 9.19], I2=64%). Out of a pooled 24 implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs) and 11 wearable cardiac defibrillators (WCDs), there was only one appropriate and one inappropriate ICD discharge recorded over the follow-up period.  ConclusionIn this cohort, SCAD with concurrent CA was associated with worse in-hospital and long-term outcomes including in-hospital and post-discharge mortality, acute heart failure, and recurrent MI and SCAD. There was a low long-term rate of administered defibrillator therapies among patients discharged from the hospital with an ICD or WCD.

Key MessagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABSPrevious retrospective and prospective clinical studies have suggested that attention should be paid to the risk of subsequent malignant ventricular arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, in patients with acute myocardial infarction.  What this study adds?We used Mendelian randomization to demonstrate the genetic relationship between acute myocardial infarction and paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia, and found that leptin mediated the occurrence of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia in clinical patients with acute myocardial infarction for the first time. In addition, we also found a large number of cardiovascular proteins closely genetically related to acute myocardial infarction or paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia,  How this study might affect research, practice or policy?Our research provides a new insight which means that appropriate serological detection or intervention for patients with acute myocardial infarction can predict or prevent the occurrence of secondary malignant ventricular arrhythmias and reduce the mortality of patients with acute myocardial infarction in the future. Also, the cardiovascular proteins detected by Mendelian randomization analysis are helpful for the diagnosis and prevention of the two.

Borges (fxmedbrasil@gmail.com),"['1 Professor of Medicine, Endocrinology and Clinical Nutrition / Independent Medical Scientist , Brazil']","ObjectiveTo conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral testosterone therapy in hypogonadal men. The primary outcome is the assessment of safety, focusing on cardiovascular risks, liver toxicity, and prostate safety. Secondary outcomes include evaluations of bone mass, cardiovascular benefits, cognitive function, and potential reductions in mortality.  MethodsA systematic search was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library, identifying peer-reviewed studies published until August 2024. The search included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and large clinical trials. The studies involved a total of 3,183 hypogonadal men. Data were extracted and analyzed to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Statistical methods for meta-analysis included fixed-effects and random-effects models to calculate pooled estimates and assess heterogeneity.  ResultsThe analysis included 21 studies, encompassing a total of 3,183 hypogonadal men. Oral testosterone therapy demonstrated a safety profile comparable to other testosterone replacement therapies (TRT). No significant increase in liver toxicity was observed, supported by studies showing no liver damage after long-term oral testosterone undecanoate (TU) administration. Cardiovascular safety results were mixed; some studies noted minor increases in systolic blood pressure, but there was no consistent evidence of a significant increase in major cardiovascular events compared to other TRT forms. The prostate safety profile was consistent with existing TRT modalities, with only minor increases in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels noted.Secondary outcomes were generally favorable: bone density improved, fat mass was reduced, and there were indications of cognitive benefits, although these findings varied across studies. However, the evidence for mortality reduction was inconclusive, with no strong data supporting a significant effect of oral testosterone on reducing mortality.  ConclusionOral testosterone therapy appears to be a safe and effective treatment for hypogonadal men, with a risk profile comparable to other TRT forms. It offers potential benefits in bone health and cognitive function but requires careful monitoring of cardiovascular health and prostate safety during treatment. The findings suggest that oral testosterone therapy can be a valuable option for hypogonadal men, though long-term studies are needed to better understand its full range of effects, particularly concerning mortality and cardiovascular outcomes."

ResultsA total of 283 patients were included in this study, with an average age of 64.0 [54.0,70.5] years, including 193 males and 90 females. We divided RDW into three groups (high, moderate and low) according to RDW tertiles and then compared the mortality of the three groups. The high RDW group (RDW > 16.8%) had significant higher mortality (P = 0.031). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, RDW, SOFA score and APS are risk factors for death in diabetic foot. After adjusting for confounding factors in model II, RDW remains a particularly strong predictor of mortality.  ConclusionsA total of 283 patients were included in this study, with an average age of 64.0 [54.0,70.5] years, including 1We confirm that RDW is an independent predictor of mortality in DF patients,and the higher the RDW, the higher the mortality of DF patients."

Here, we use a personalized multiscale generative brain model to characterize direct spatiotemporal links between genes and multimodal neuroimaging-derived biological factors in PD. We identified a set of genes modulating PD-associated longitudinal changes in dopamine transporter level, neuronal activity, dendrite density and tissue atrophy. Inter-individual heterogeneity in the gene-mediated biological mechanisms is associated with five distinct configurations of PD motor and non-motor symptoms. Although characterized by distinctive biological pathways, all the symptom configurations are associated with cell cycle processes. Notably, the protein-protein interaction networks underlying these configurations revealed distinct hub genes including MYC, CCNA2, CCDK1, SRC, STAT3 and PSMD4. We also uncovered the biological mechanisms associated with physical activities performance in PD, and observed that leisure and work activities are principally related to neurotypical cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response processes, respectively. Finally, patient-tailored in silico gene perturbations revealed a set of putative disease-modifying drugs with potential to effectively treat PD, most of which are associated with dopamine reuptake and anti-inflammation. Our study constitutes the first self-contained multiscale approach providing comprehensive insights into the complex multifactorial pathogenesis of PD, unravelling key biological modulators of physical and clinical deterioration, and serving as a blueprint for optimum drug selection at personalized level."

Thus, this paper aims to explore whether television watching, white-collar jobs, and unemployment are working as sedentary behavior to increase overweight and obesity in Bangladesh.  Data and methodsWe utilized cross-sectional data from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2017-2018. The dependent variable of the study was the nutritional status of women using three different measures: body mass index (BMI), Asian body mass index (ABMI), and tri-ponderal mass index (TMI). The frequency of watching television (TV) and types of employment were the two predictors of overweight and obesity in this study. The Multilevel Ordered Logistic Regression Analysis was used in this study.  ResultsWomen who have watched television at least once a week are more likely to have a BMI [&ge;]25 and become overweight (30.3%) and obese (9.3%) than those who did not watch TV at all (20.1% and 3%). This same pattern of BMI is discernible among unemployed women (28.7% and 8.2%) compared to women in agricultural work (16% and 2.9%). Professional women have the highest risk of being overweight and obese (35.4% and 10.9%). The pattern of overweight and obese is consistent for ABMI and PMI. However, these indicators (ABMI & PMI) report a higher prevalence of overweight and obesity than BMI.  ConclusionIn this era of technology, TV watching, and other technology will increase with time. More and more women are engaging in white-collar jobs or looking for jobs. In these circumstances, policymakers need to focus on how this use of technology can decrease overweight and obesity among women. More studies need to be conducted to explore the effect of other sedentary behaviors and take steps based on those studies to reduce the increasing rate of overweight and obesity."

This paper documents how household structure relates to individual health behaviours.  Study designWe pooled cross-sectional data from the Portuguese National Health Interview Surveys of 2014 and 2019, covering 26,000+ households.  MethodsLinear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association between different household compositions (single dwelling adults, single parents, couples with or without children) and adherence to the Mediterranean diet, frequency of physical activity, likelihood of risky alcohol consumption, and smoking, distinguishing between men and women.  ResultsPeople living alone and single parents were significantly less likely to adhere to the Mediterranean diet than individuals living in couple. Single dwellers had significantly higher likelihood of engaging in risky alcohol consumption or being smokers than individuals living in couple and/or with children. Analyses by gender revealed that women in couples with children were less likely to practice physical activity than women in couples without children; this difference was not observed among men.  ConclusionsOverall, family contexts strongly correlate with individual health behaviours, with people living alone or in single-parent households appearing at higher risk of having less healthy diets, risky alcohol consumption, and smoking. This study identifies key target groups for policies aiming to improve population health (behaviours) including, critically, single dwellers and single parent households.  Key massagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSSocial relationships, particularly within the family, play a significant role in shaping individuals health behaviors. With rapid changes in family structures, understanding how household composition influences adult behaviors is crucial.  What this study addsThis study reveals that single dwellers generally exhibit unhealthier behaviors, except in the case of physical activity. Additionally, it highlights that having children tends to promote healthier lifestyles among couples.  How this study might affect research, practice, or policyThe findings underscore the importance of considering household composition in health interventions and policy development. Specifically, attention may need to be directed towards individuals living alone and single-parent households to address potential health disparities and promote healthier behaviors."

Resnick', 'Murat Bilgel']",Alisa Bannerjee (murat.bilgel@nih.gov),"['1 Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, National Institute on Aging , Baltimore, Maryland, USA']","Background and ObjectivesSubjective cognitive complaints often precede declines in objective measures of cognitive performance and may facilitate the early diagnosis of cognitive impairment. This study examined whether amyloid and tau pathology are associated with level and longitudinal change in subjective cognitive complaints among cognitively normal individuals, and compared these associations to those observed with objective neuropsychological measures of verbal episodic memory performance.  MethodsAmyloid and tau pathology were measured by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) and 18F-flortaucipir (FTP) PET scans, respectively. FTP PET regions of interest (ROIs) included the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and inferior temporal gyrus. Subjective cognitive complaints were assessed using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) immediate and long-delayed free recall scores were used to quantify objective memory performance. We examined the association of PET measures with rates of change in CFQ and verbal memory within 5 years of the PET scans using linear mixed effects models.  ResultsWe analyzed data for 92 cognitively normal participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). In analyses that included both amyloid positivity and regional tau burden as predictors greater parahippocampal tau standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was associated with higher CFQ, indicating greater subjective cognitive complaints (estimate = 0.178, SE = 0.0821, p = 0.033). Greater entorhinal tau SUVR corresponded to an attenuated increase in CFQ over time (estimate = -0.064, SE = 0.0296, p = 0.035), whereas greater hippocampal tau SUVR was associated with a steeper longitudinal decline in memory (estimate = -0.0293, SE = 0.0135, p = 0.032).  DiscussionIndividuals with higher levels of tau pathology may experience greater levels of subjective cognitive complaints. Such associations are detectable among cognitively normal individuals even in the absence of marked neuropathology-associated differences in neuropsychological assessments of verbal episodic memory, suggesting that subjective cognitive complaints may serve as early indicators of accumulating cerebral tau pathology."

The surgical approach--open, laparoscopic, or robot-assisted--can influence perioperative outcomes. This study evaluates acute kidney injury (AKI) and perioperative complications across these modalities.  MethodsWe conducted a retrospective analysis using the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) of 2020-2021 to examine 12,676 kidney cancer patients who underwent nephrectomy. Patients were stratified by surgical approach: open, laparoscopic, and robot-assisted. Primary outcomes included AKI incidence, length of stay, and intra- and post-operative complications. Multivariable regression models adjusted for confounding variables, including age, sex, race, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), hospital region, and teaching status.  ResultsPatients undergoing open nephrectomy had the highest AKI rates, particularly for radical nephrectomy (22.13% vs. 16.52% for robotic, p < 0.001). Similarly, patients treated with open surgery had longer hospital stays and higher rates of complications, including pulmonary (7.71% vs. 4.17%, p < 0.001) and vascular (12.11% vs. 4.01%, p < 0.001) in radical nephrectomy. Multivariate analysis confirmed the increased risk of AKI and complications in open nephrectomy, with robotic-assisted surgery demonstrating the best perioperative outcomes.  ConclusionOpen nephrectomy, whether partial or radical, is associated with higher AKI rates and perioperative complications compared to laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgeries. Robot-assisted nephrectomy, with its lower complication rates and shorter hospital stays, may be the preferred approach when feasible. Further efforts to expand access to minimally invasive techniques could improve outcomes for kidney cancer patients."

Here, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is thought to play an important role. BDNF, a member of the neurotrophin family, is implicated in processes such as synaptogenesis and long-term potentiation. Post-stroke, reduced BDNF levels are observed compared to the healthy population. An intervention that has been shown to elevate BDNF is Aerobic exercise. Yet, the impact of aerobic exercise in stroke patients remains unclear. This sub-analysis of the multicenter, randomized, controlled Physical Fitness Training in Patients with Subacute Stroke trial aimed to investigate serum BDNF dynamics and the effects of a four-week aerobic exercise intervention on long- term BDNF levels.  Data from 200 patients, with missing data imputed, revealed a modest increase in serum BDNF levels up to three months post-stroke (22.6 ng/ml, 95% CI 19.2 to 26) which plateaued until six months (24.3 ng/ml, 95% CI 20.6 to 27.9). Despite higher baseline BDNF levels in the exercise group, no treatment effect was observed until six months (training 24.6 ng/ml, 95% CI 20.2 to 29 vs relaxation: 24.3 ng/ml, 95% CI 19.8 to 28.8, p = 0.95). A sex-related interaction was identified in the relaxation group, with female patients exhibiting higher BDNF increases until end of follow up (20.9 ng/ml, 95% CI 15.7 to 26.2 (males) vs 31.0 ng/ml, 95% CI 22.9 to 39.0 (females), p = 0.039). Dose-response analyses and associations with recurrent events yielded no substantial differences.  While serum BDNF levels increased early after stroke in the first three months, aerobic exercise did not demonstrate a significant impact on BDNF levels within this dataset. Further investigations with more measurements during the early subacute phase are warranted to elucidate the interplay between exercise, BDNF, and recovery."

Although New Zealand has one of the highest incidence and mortality rates of MND globally, the reasons for this are yet to be determined.  In light of this lack of systematic genetic MND research in New Zealand, we sought to identify the frequencies of genetic variants in known MND-linked genes in people in New Zealand with MND. A total of 184 participants were enrolled; 149 with a clinical diagnosis of MND and 35 who were clinically unaffected but at risk of familial MND.

Participants DNA was screened for genetic variation in 46 MND-associated genes using a combination of Sanger sequencing, Illumina single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray, repeat-primed PCR for C9orf72, and an Invitae gene panel.  Clinical phenotypes of participants with MND recapitulated the trends seen in European reference populations with both males, and individuals with spinal onset, having earlier disease onset. Thirty three of the 184 participants (17.9%) carried known pathogenic variants; the majority had C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion (24/34), and the remainder had previously reported pathogenic genetic variants in SOD1 (9/34; p.(Ile114Thr) and p.(Glu101Gly)).

Benign enlargement of the subarachnoid space (BESS), a condition marked by increased eaCSF thickness, has been associated with macrocephaly and may be associated with subdural collections. However, diagnosis of BESS is complicated by the lack of age-specific normative data which hinders rigorous investigation of its clinical associations. Growth charts of eaCSF could shed light on normal CSF dynamics while also providing a normative benchmark to assist the diagnosis of BESS and other associated conditions.  MethodsWe accessed clinically-acquired T1w MRI scans from 1226 pediatric patients to form a clinical control cohort. Nine scans from subjects with a diagnosis of BESS from a board-certified pediatric neuroradiologist were also reviewed. SynthSeg was used to segment each T1w scan into various tissue types, including eaCSF. Growth charts of eaCSF were modeled using the clinical control cohort. The confirmed BESS cases were then benchmarked against these charts to test the performance of eaCSF growth charts.  ResultseaCSF thickness varied nonlinearly with age, steadily decreasing from birth to two years, then trending upwards in early adolescence. Seven of the nine patients with a clinical diagnosis of BESS were above the 97.5th percentile for their age for at least one eaCSF measure. Centile scores were able to distinguish BESS cases from controls with an area under curve (AUC) greater than 0.95.  DiscussioneaCSF thickness evolves in a dynamic pattern throughout childhood and adolescence. Patients with BESS can be differentiated from clinical controls using computational measurements of eaCSF thickness paired with normative modeling. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of computational extraction of eaCSF with a potential point of clinical relevance, delineation of BESS diagnosis. Enhanced understanding of normative eaCSF is critical in further investigations its clinical associations."

Among pregnant individuals with uterine fibroids, myomectomy at the time of cesarean delivery (CD) allows individuals to avoid a second surgery later in life.  ObjectiveTo examine the safety of myomectomy performed at the time of CD and the factors that increase the risk of greater blood loss in cesarean myomectomy.  Study designThis was a retrospective cohort study of all cesarean myomectomies (CM) performed at a tertiary care center in Toronto, Ontario between January 1, 2012, and June 1, 2019. The study group included individuals who had CM, and the control group included individuals with fibroids who had a CD without removing their fibroids. The primary outcome was the rate of blood products transfusion. Secondary outcomes were the need for hysterectomy and estimated blood loss (EBL). Subgroup analyses were performed for fibroid size, previous CD, and elective vs urgent CD. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess for confounders.  ResultsOverall, 110 CM were compared with 152 CD. The overall transfusion rate for CM was 7.3% compared to 0.7% in the control group (p = 0.005). All procedures requiring transfusion from both groups were performed < 370/7 weeks of gestation. In logistic regression analysis, performing a myomectomy was not associated with a higher risk for transfusion. The only factors associated with transfusion were preterm birth (aOR 14.43, p=0.049) and low pre-operative hemoglobin (aOR 0.90, p=0.02). The median reported EBL was 800 mL for CM and 700 mL for controls (p<0.001). No individuals in either group required concomitant hysterectomy. Subgroup analysis showed that fibroid size [&ge;]5cm and previous CD were not associated with increased risk of transfusion among those who had a CM, while urgent CM was significantly associated with the need for transfusion (p=0.02).  ConclusionThis study demonstrates that the transfusion rate was not significantly higher in those undergoing CM at term, compared to those with fibroids undergoing CD without a myomectomy."

We identify specific subtypes of stromal and immune cells critical to forming a pro-tumor microenvironment in metastatic lesions, including CCL2+ macrophages, cytotoxic T cells with an exhausted gene signature, and FOXP3+ regulatory T cells. Analysis of cell-cell communication highlights a marked decrease in tumor-immune cell interactions in metastatic tissues, likely strengthening the immunosuppressive microenvironment.

This study aimed to evaluate CRC screening prevalence among this newly eligible population and examine associations with healthcare provider supply and CT colonography facility availability in 2022.  MethodsUsing 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data (n=25,592), we estimated CRC screening prevalence among adults aged 45-49. We examined associations between screening rates and state-level healthcare provider supply using 2021-2022 Area Health Resources File data. Spearman rank-order correlations assessed relationships between provider supply, CT colonography facility availability, and screening prevalence.  ResultsOverall CRC screening prevalence was 34.5% (95% CI: 33.4%-35.8%). Endoscopic tests were most common (74.9%), followed by stool-based tests (9.3%) and CT colonography (0.5%). Significant variations in screening modalities were observed across sociodemographic factors. Gastroenterology physician supply positively correlated with overall CRC screening prevalence ({rho}=0.42, P=.002) and endoscopy screening prevalence ({rho}=0.39, P=.005). CT colonography facility availability weakly correlated with CT colonography screening prevalence ({rho}=0.18, P=.22).  ConclusionsCRC screening rates among newly eligible adults aged 45-49 appear to be suboptimal in 2022. Disparities in screening methods across sociodemographic factors highlight potential access barriers. The association between gastroenterology physician supply and screening rates emphasizes the importance of addressing projected workforce shortages. Targeted efforts are needed to increase CRC screening uptake in this age group and ensure equitable access to screening services."

This raises the importance of understanding to what degree national action so far has been effective. Answering this question is challenged by variation in data availability and quality as well as disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate the association between a survey of self-reported action based on the first Global Database for Tracking Antimicrobial Resistance (TrACSS) survey and trends in multiple indicators related to the DPSEEA framework leading up to the survey.  Methods and findingsWe apply regression methods across 73 countries between actions in 2016 and the trend in indicators of health system development (drivers), antibiotic use (pressures, ABU), absolute rates of resistance (state, ABR) and relative rates of resistance (exposure, Drug Resistance Index, DRI) from 2000 to 2016. We find that action is consistently associated with improved linear and categorical trend in health systems, ABU, ABR and DRI. Reductions are associated with relatively high levels of action (0-4) for ABU (median 2.8, 25-75% quartile 2.6-3.3), ABR (3.0, 2.4-3.4), and DRI (3.5, 3.1-3.6). These associations are robust to the inclusion of other contextual factors such as health system and socio-economic status, human population density, animal production and climate. Since 2016, a majority of both Low-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and High-Income Countries (HICs) report increased action on repeated questions, while one third of countries report reduced action. The main limitations in interpretation are heterogeneity in data availability and the recency of action.  ConclusionsOur findings highlight the importance of national action to address the domestic situation related to antibiotic resistance and indicate the value of both incremental changes in reducing adverse outcomes and the need for high levels of action in delivering improvements."

DesignProspective open cohort study design.  SettingPrimary and secondary care in England as provided by Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Gold  ParticipantsAn open cohort of 3 million adults aged 25 to 84 years was identified using linked primary and secondary electronic health records from 291 and 98 general practices in England and were used for model development and validation, respectively (i.e., general population cohort). Additionally, a second cohort of patients with diabetes was extracted. At study entry, patients in both cohorts were free of CVD and not prescribed statins.  MethodsTRisk utilised all diagnosis, medication, procedure, and clinical test data up to study entry in linked longitudinal primary and secondary care electronic health records for prediction of 10-year risk of CVD. Discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analyses were conducted to investigate predictive performance. The proposed model was also compared against QRISK3 and a deep learning derivation model of QRISK3 (DeepSurv). Additional analyses compared discriminatory performance in other age groups, by sex, and across categories of socioeconomic status.  Main outcome measuresIncident cardiovascular disease recorded in either linked general practice or hospital admission datasets provided by CPRD Gold.  ResultsTRisk demonstrated superior discrimination (C-index in the general population: 0.910; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.906 to 0.913). TRisks performance was found to be less sensitive to population age range than the benchmark models and outperformed other models also in analyses stratified by age, sex or socioeconomic status. All models were overall well-calibrated. In decision curve analyses, TRisk demonstrated greater net benefit than benchmark models across the range of relevant thresholds. At both the recommended 10% risk threshold and the 15% risk threshold, TRisk reduced both the total number of patients classified at high risk (by 22% and 35% respectively) and the number of false negatives as compared with currently recommended strategies. TRisk similarly outperformed other models in patients with diabetes. Compared with the widely recommended treat-all policy approach for patients with diabetes, TRisk at a 10% risk threshold would lead to deselection of 24% of individuals with a small fraction of false negatives (0.2% of cohort).  ConclusionTRisk enabled a more targeted selection of individuals at risk of CVD compared to benchmark statistical and deep learning models, in both the general population and patients with diabetes. Incorporation of TRisk into routine clinical care would allow a reduction in the number of treatment-eligible patients by approximately one-third while preventing at least as many events as with currently adopted approaches."

Admissions were return visits to the ED within 30 days resulting in hospitalization.  ResultsAmong 1,409 caregiver-patient dyads, ZBI scores averaged 7.33 (SD = 7.11). Most caregivers were women (69%). Caregivers were most often spouses (48%) of patients or children of patients (38%). Among all patients, 5.3% returned to the ED within 3 days, 9.4% returned within 7 days, 20.7% returned within 30 days and 6.2% were admitted within 30 days. Each point increase on the ZBI scale was associated with a 2.8% increase in the odds of a 30-day revisit to the ED (p = 0.03), but not in models with shorter time windows, nor for admissions. ZBI scores on 30-day ED revisits were moderated by the COVID-19 pandemic waves: the first inter-wave period attenuated the association.  Conclusions and RelevanceCaregiver burden may modestly predict ED revisits over 30 days. Future studies may enhance the management of ED revisits by predicting the longitudinal impact of caregiver burden on ED use in older adults.  Trial Registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04093245  Key pointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSCan caregiver burden predict emergency department (ED) revisits and admissions within 30 days of discharge among older adults?  FindingsIn this prospective cohort study, higher caregiver burden was associated with a modest increase in the likelihood of 30-day ED revisits, though not with shorter-term revisits or admissions.  MeaningReducing caregiver burden may help prevent returns to the ED within 30 days among community-dwelling older adults."

This study aimed to investigate the significance of the airborne transmissions and the effectiveness of air cleaning in reducing infections among children in daycare.  MethodsA cross-over study was conducted in four daycare centers in Helsinki. All children attending the daycare were invited to participate (n = 262) and the sole inclusion criterion was that the children were expected to stay in the same day care center for the two-year duration of the study. 51 subjects were included in the final analysis. Clean air flow rate was increased by 2.1-2.9 times compared to baseline mechanical ventilation of the premises. The effect of intervention was assessed using negative binomial regression.  ResultsThe intervention reduced incident infections from 0.95 to 0.78 infections per child per month among the children (primary outcome) in daycare. The reduction attributed to intervention in the statistical model was 18.0 % (95% CI 2.1-31.3 %, p = 0.028).  ConclusionsWe observed a significant decrease in incident infections without implementing any other infection mitigation strategies but air cleaning. Our results challenge the current paradigm which emphasizes fomite and contact transmission and infection control measures that target these pathways. As ventilation and air cleaning can only affect particles able to float in the air stream, our results support the significance of airborne transmission among common respiratory pathogens as well as air cleaning as an infection control measure."

Currently, it is unknown if specific subtypes of cognitive impairments differentially relate to post-stroke depression severity. This study aimed to explore the differential associations between within-domain cognitive impairment to depression severity six-months after stroke.  MethodParticipants (n = 385, Age M = 73.86 years [SD = 12.51], National Institutes of Health Stroke Severity M = 6.83 [SD = 6.01]) were recruited from an acute stroke ward. Participants completed a self-report mood measure (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS) and a stroke-specific cognitive assessment (Oxford Cognitive Screen; OCS). Separate multiple regressions predicting depression were conducted across 1) OCS domain-specific cognitive impairments of language, memory, attention, praxis, numeracy and executive function, and 2) the novel subtask-specific impairments within each OCS domain. Anxiety severity and years of education attained were included as covariates.  ResultsWithin-domain impairments that were uniquely associated with depression severity were calculation (b(.57) = 1.44, 95% CI [0.31, 2.56], p = .012), episodic memory (b(.52) = 1.36, 95% CI [0.34, 2.37], p = .009), picture naming (b(.45) = 1.18, 95% CI [0.31, 2.06], p = .008), number writing (b(.46) = 2.54, 95% CI [0.26, 2.07], p = .012), and visuospatial attention (b(.35) = 1.24, 95% CI [0.54, 1.93], p = .001). Analysis in pooled multiply imputed data (N = 430) corroborated complete case analysis findings.  ConclusionsSpecific within-domain cognitive impairments have differential relationships with post-stroke depressive symptomology. Accommodating for these impairments in post-stroke depression interventions may potentially enhance therapeutic outcomes."

Despite its prevalence and morbidity, CPPDs are often inadequately managed with few patients experiencing relief from any medical intervention. Characterizing mental health symptom trajectories and lifestyle predictors of mental health is a starting point to enhancing patient self-efficacy in managing symptoms. Here, we investigate the association between mental health, pain, and physical activity (PA) in females with CPPD and demonstrate a method for handling multi-modal mobile health (mHealth) data.  MethodThe study sample included 4,270 person-level days and 799 person-level weeks of data from CPPD participants (N=76). Participants recorded PROMIS global mental health (GMH) and physical functioning, and pain weekly for 14 weeks using a research mHealth app, and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was passively collected via activity trackers.  Data analysisWe used penalized functional regression (PFR) to regress weekly GMH-T (GMH-T) on MVPA and weekly pain outcomes, while adjusting for baseline measures, time in study, and the random intercept of the individual. We converted 7-day MVPA data into a single smooth using spline basis functions to model the potential non-linear relationship.  ResultsMVPA was a significant, curvilinear predictor of GMH-T (p<0.001), independent of pain measures and prior psychiatric diagnosis. Physical functioning was positively associated with GMH-T, while pain was negatively associated with GMH-T ({beta}=2.24, {beta}=-1.16, respectively; p<0.05).  ConclusionThese findings suggest that engaging in MVPA is beneficial to the mental health of females with CPPD. Additionally, this study demonstrates the potential of ambulatory mHealth-based data combined with functional models for delineating inter-individual and temporal variability."

Compared to a standard analysis, sfFDR substantially increased power (equivalent to a 60% increase in sample size) in a study of obesity-related traits from the UK Biobank, and discovered eight additional lead SNPs near genes linked to immune-related responses in a rare disease GWAS of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Collectively, these results highlight the utility of exploiting related traits in both small and large studies."

Genetic effects on gene expression have been extensively characterized by expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies, yet data from non-European populations is limited. This restricts our understanding of disease to genes whose regulatory variants are common in European populations. While previous work has leveraged data from multiple populations to improve GWAS power and polygenic risk score (PRS) accuracy, multi-ancestry data has not yet been used to better estimate cis-genetic effects on gene expression. Here, we present a new method, Multi-Ancestry Gene Expression Prediction Regularized Optimization (MAGEPRO), which constructs robust genetic models of gene expression in understudied populations or cell types by fitting a regularized linear combination of eQTL summary data across diverse cohorts. In simulations, our tool generates more accurate models of gene expression than widely-used LASSO and the state-of-the-art multi-ancestry PRS method, PRS-CSx, adapted to gene expression prediction. We attribute this improvement to MAGEPROs ability to more accurately estimate causal eQTL effect sizes (p < 3.98 x 10-4, two-sided paired t-test). With real data, we applied MAGEPRO to 8 eQTL cohorts representing 3 ancestries (average n = 355) and consistently outperformed each of 6 competing methods in gene expression prediction tasks. Integration with GWAS summary statistics across 66 complex traits (representing 22 phenotypes and 3 ancestries) resulted in 2,331 new gene-trait associations, many of which replicate across multiple ancestries, including PHTF1 linked to white blood cell count, a gene which is overexpressed in leukemia patients. MAGEPRO also identified biologically plausible novel findings, such as PIGB, an essential component of GPI biosynthesis, associated with heart failure, which has been previously evidenced by clinical outcome data. Overall, MAGEPRO is a powerful tool to enhance inference of gene regulatory effects in underpowered datasets and has improved our understanding of population-specific and shared genetic effects on complex traits."

However, in some research environments, its adoption is tempered by the risks AI poses to data protection, ethics, and research integrity. For research funding organisations (RFOs), although there is interest in the application of AI to boost productivity, there is also uncertainty around AIs utility and its safe integration into organisational systems and processes. The scoping review explored:  What does the evidence say about the current and emerging use of AI?;  What are the potential benefits of AI for RFOs? and  What are the considerations and risks of AI for RFOs?  MethodsA scoping review was undertaken with no study, language, or field limits. Due to the rapidly evolving AI field, searches were limited to the last three years (2022-2024). Four databases were searched for academic and grey literature in February 2024 (including 13 funding and professional research organisation websites). A classification framework captured the utility and potential, and considerations and risks of AI for RFOs.  Results122 eligible articles revealed that current and emerging AI solutions could potentially benefit RFOs by enhancing data processes, administration, research insights, operational management, and strategic decision-making. These solutions ranged from AI algorithms to data management platforms, frameworks, guidelines, and business models. However, several considerations and risks need to be addressed before RFOs can successfully integrate AI (e.g., improving data quality, regulating ethical use, data science training).  ConclusionWhile RFOs could potentially benefit from a breadth of AI-driven solutions to improve operations, decision-making and data management, there is a need to assess organisational  AI readiness. Although technological advances could be the solution there is a need to address AI accountability, governance and ethics, address societal impact, and the risks to the research funding landscape."

We used linear regression to determine the association between 354 neuroimaging-derived brain measures and alcohol use defined as drinks per week, pack years of smoking, and drinks per week x pack years smoking interaction. To assess whether the brain associations with alcohol are broadly similar or different from the associations with smoking, we calculated the correlation between z-scores of association for drinks per week and pack years smoking.  Results indicated overall moderate positive correlation in the associations across measures representing brain structure, magnetic susceptibility, and white matter tract microstructure, indicating greater similarity than difference in the brain measures associated with alcohol use and smoking. The only evidence of an interaction between drinks per week and pack years smoking was seen in measures representing magnetic susceptibility in subcortical structures. The effects of alcohol use and smoking on brain health appeared to be additive rather than multiplicative for all other brain measures studied. 97% (224/230) of associations with alcohol and 100% (167/167) of the associations with smoking that surpassed a p value threshold are in a direction that can be interpreted to reflect reduced brain health.

The patient-specific simulation showed that at peak systole, the dynamic interplay between high IF displacement and high transmural pressures promoted true lumen compression and false lumen expansion, while luminal patterns were reversed at the deceleration phase. High vorticity and swirling flow patterns were observed throughout the cardiac cycle at the primary entry tear, the descending aorta and proximal to the visceral aortic branches, correlating with high relative residence time, which could indicate an increased localised risk of aortic growth proximal to the IF. A rigid IF simulation revealed significant discrepancies in haemodynamic metrics, highlighting the potential mispredictions when using a rigid wall assumption to assess disease progression. Simulations assuming a more compliant IF highlighted increased risks of visceral branches malperfusion and localised aortic wall degeneration.

However, few studies offer detailed insights into the entirety of prehospital pathways in patients with stroke. Therefore, this study aimed to lay the foundation for artificial intelligence (AI) decision support tools in EMCCs by exploring their ability to detect strokes in medical emergency calls, describe a novel method for stroke sensitivity calculation in the EMCC, and identify factors associated with stroke recognition during a call.  MethodsIn total, 1,164 patients with stroke in the catchment area of Bergen EMCC in 2018 and 2019 were included, and a dataset from the EMCC was established manually and linked with data from the Norwegian Stroke Registry (NSR) for analysis. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square test for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables, and multivariate logistic regression (LR) were performed on data obtained from patients primarily assessed by EMCC (n=838).

Duration of hospital stay [aOR=2.30; 95%CI (1.552-3.398); p=<0.001], history of antepartum hemorrhage [aOR=29.09; 95% CI (1.182-716.38); p=0.039] and Anemia [aOR=0.01; 95% CI (0.001-0.218); p=0.004] were identified as factors associated with puerperal sepsis among postnatal women upon multivariate logistic regression.  ConclusionPuerperal sepsis was common in our setting. This study found that mode of delivery, duration of hospital stay, anemia, and Antepartum hemorrhage, were the determining factors contributing to puerperal sepsis, infection prevention measures during cesarean sections, and reducing the length of hospital stay would prove to be beneficial in the prevention of sepsis."

AimTo assess the potential cost-effectiveness of the Sparkbrooks Children Zone (SCZ), a pilot clinic for children and young people which integrates health and early years support in a highly deprived area of Birmingham, the UKs second city, compared with standard primary care.  MethodsA decision-analytic model taking healthcare and partial social care perspective was developed using best available, though limited, evidence from aggregated data of an ongoing pilot, published literature, expert opinions and assumptions. Effectiveness was measured as proportion of patients attending the emergency department. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of parameter uncertainties.  ResultsThe integrated SCZ clinic may potentially be cost-effective based on this preliminary model-based analysis. The SCZ had lower proportion of patients attending emergency department, 0.017 compared with 0.029 for standard primary care, reducing proportion of emergency department visits by 0.012. The average cost of SCZ was {pound}66.22 compared with {pound}110.36 for standard primary care, leading to a cost-saving of {pound}44.08 per patient. This potential reduction in total costs resulting from fewer referrals to childrens social care and secondary medical services, including the emergency department. Extensive sensitivity analysis supported the indications that the intervention was likely to be cost-effective.  ConclusionThe SCZ pilot shows potential in integrating health and social care within a community setting, with Its early years services likely enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the SCZ compared to standard primary care. Further robust data and trial evaluation are essential to confirm these findings, ensuring the scalability and sustainability of such programs."

We aimed at investigating corresponding cost-effectiveness issues.  MethodsAll persons involved in the primary analysis of the QUATUOR noninferiority trial were considered (N=636, 318 per arm) in this cost-effectiveness study. Time horizon was the first 48 weeks of the trial. Effectiveness was considered as the noninferiority of the 4/7-days strategy, main criterion of the trial primary analysis. Direct health resource costs (year2022{euro}) were considered and included costs for ART, laboratory tests, co-medications, hospitalizations, and medical consultations. Analyses were based on 10,000 simulations replicating the trial. Additional analyses explored the national impact of spreading the 4/7-days strategy all over France. Sensitivity analyses included considering treatment success as effectiveness, and various proportions of persons adopting the 4/7-days strategy.  FindingsThe mean individual total costs amounted to {euro} 5,049 [95% confidence interval: 4,798-5,345] and {euro} 8,089 [7,706-8,527] in the 4/7-days and 7/7-days arm, respectively. Corresponding ART costs were {euro} 3,678 [3,593-3,763] and {euro} 6,450 [6,301-6,596], respectively (p<0.0001), and constituted the single cost element with a statistical difference between the two strategies. Considering noninferiority as the effectiveness criterion in a health economic perspective, the 4/7-day strategy provided average savings of {euro} 3,013 [2829-3196] in ART costs per individual and per year. Adopting the 4/7-days regimen in 20% of the potential recipients in France was estimated to provide annual savings of {euro} 61,752,467 [61,569,005; 61,925,136].  InterpretationThe 4/7-day strategy dominates the 7/7-day strategy since it spares substantial ART costs while maintaining treatment effectiveness. Study results support generalizing the adoption of 4/7-days triple ART regimens in France, when possible."

Reaction times from the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) can be used to quantify alcohol approach bias. However, only a handful of studies have investigated the neural correlates of implicit alcohol approach behavior. Graph Theory Analysis (GTA) metrics, specifically, weighted global efficiency (wGE), community detection, and inter-community information integration were used to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of an in-scanner version of the AAT from 31 heavy drinking Veterans with AUD (HDV) engaged in out-patient treatment and 19 healthy Veterans as controls (HC). We found a functional imprint of alcohol approach bias in HDVs. HDVs showed significantly higher wGE values for approaching than for avoiding alcohol, indicating that their brain was more efficiently organized or functionally set to approach alcohol in the presence to alcohol-related external cues. In contrast, Brains of HCs did not show such a processing advantage for either the approach or avoid condition. Further post-hoc analyses revealed that HDVs and HCs differed in how they implemented top-down control when approaching/avoiding alcohol and in how the fronto-parietal control network interacted with subsystems of the default mode network. These findings contribute to understanding the complex neural underpinnings of alcohol approach bias and lay the foundation for developing more potent and targeted interventions to modify these neural patterns in AUD patients."

These disorders are defined by abnormal fat distribution, with near-total (generalized lipodystrophy, GL) or partial (partial lipodystrophy, PL; i.e. familial partial lipodystrophy, FPLD) absence of adipocyte mass leading to a decreased ability to store lipids safely. Excess lipids are more likely to be stored in non-adipose tissues, which leads to the metabolic manifestations. We have recently shown that glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists are associated with metabolic improvements in FPLD. We hypothesized that tirzepatide, a dual incretin, may also lead to metabolic improvement in patients with lipodystrophy.  MethodsObservational cohort of patients with PL or GL who received tirzepatide clinically were tracked in the context of ongoing natural history studies.  ResultsSeventeen patients received tirzepatide, 14 with FPLD (ages within 30-74 years; 12 female 2 male). After a median 8.7 months of follow-up, BMI (median{Delta} -1.7; range -5.9 to 0.9 kg/m2; p=0.008), HbA1c (median{Delta} -1.1%; range -6.3 to -0.1%; p<0.001), triglycerides [median{Delta} - 65 mg/dL (-0.73 mmol/L); range -3820 to 43 mg/dL (-43.2 to 0.49 mmol/L); p=0.003] and total daily insulin requirements (median{Delta} -109; range -315 to 0 units/day; p=0.002) were significantly reduced. Three patients with acquired GL (Ages within 35-64 years; all female) also demonstrated a robust response to tirzepatide with reduced BMI (22.2->20.9; 26.2->25.4; 19.5->17.6 kg/m2), HbA1c (8.5%->7.0%; 10.2%->7.8%; 9.1%->6.5%), triglycerides (91->80; 641->293; 1238->100 mg/dL or 1.03->0.90; 7.24->3.31; 14.0->1.13 mmol/L), and total daily insulin requirement (85->0; 0->0; 1000->750 units/day).

While non-selective beta-blockers are established for reducing portal pressure, the efficacy of losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, remains debated. This study evaluated losartans impact on portal pressure and clinical outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  ObjectivesTo appraise evidence on the role of losartan in reducing portal pressure and associated clinical outcomes in cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension.  MethodsA comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Medline, and Web of Science. All the research and review of literature was conducted within the time period from August 20th, 2024 till August 31st, 2024 (within 1 month of submission of the paper). The Risk of Bias Visualization Tool (Robvis 2.0) and ROBINS-I were used to assess study quality. Data was extracted and analyzed using Microsoft Excel.  ResultsAmong 426 potential studies, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Both losartan and propranolol reduced hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), with some studies suggesting a more pronounced effect of losartan. Meta-analysis found no significant difference in HVPG reduction (p = 0.22), but losartan significantly reduced wedged hepatic venous pressure (WHVP) compared to propranolol (p = 0.03). Losartan also affected mean arterial pressure, renal function, and hepatic fibrosis.  ConclusionsLosartan shows potential in treating portal hypertension by reducing portal pressure and fibrosis. It may be particularly beneficial for patients unresponsive to beta-blockers, addressing both hemodynamic and structural components, and improving sodium handling in complex cases."

To improve these symptoms in SSD, physical exercise interventions show promise. We examined if reductions of functional dysconnectivity following exercise therapy are associated with clinical improvements in SSD and explored potential genetic underpinnings.  MethodsThe study utilized data from the ESPRIT C3 trial, investigating the effects of aerobic exercise versus flexibility, strengthening, and balance training on different health outcomes in individuals with SSD. Functional dysconnectivity in 23 patients relative to a healthy reference sample, was assessed both pre- and post-intervention. Changes of functional dysconnectivity after exercise and their clinical relevance were evaluated. An imaging transcriptomics approach was used to study the link between changes in functional dysconnectivity and gene expression profiles.  ResultsWe observed substantial reductions of functional dysconnectivity on the whole-brain level linked to enhanced gene expression mainly in oligodendrocytes. With regard to the clinical implications, decreases of dysconnectivity in the default-mode network were associated with improvements in global functioning. Reductions of dysconnectivity within the salience network were linked to improvements in symptom severity. Lastly, reductions of functional dysconnectivity in language regions such as Brocas area were related to cognitive benefits.  ConclusionsOur study supports a recent theory of oligodendrocyte pathology in SSD and suggests that reducing functional dysconnectivity in the default-mode, salience, and language network reflect a potential therapeutic target to improve global functioning, total symptom severity, and cognitive impairments in post-acute SSD.

For instance, when faced with modified versions of the classic ""Surgeons Dilemma"" or medical ethics cases where typical dilemmas were resolved, LLMs still reverted to standard responses, overlooking critical details. Even models designed for enhanced analytical reasoning, such as ChatGPT-o1, did not consistently overcome these limitations. This suggests that despite advancements toward fostering Type 2 thinking, LLMs remain heavily influenced by familiar patterns ingrained during training.

Their ability to correctly identify stroke influences downstream management decisions. We sought to use a large national database of prehospital clinical data to determine risk factors associated with missed EMS stroke identification.  METHODSRetrospective study examining EMS evaluation of adults with Emergency Department (ED) stroke diagnosis. We leveraged the ESO Data Collaborative research dataset containing EHR data from 2019-2022 that has a subset of encounters with linked hospital diagnostic codes. Our primary outcome was the presence of an EMS diagnosis of stroke. We evaluated the association between demographic and clinical variables with EMS stroke identification using Pearson {chi}2 test for demographic variables and multivariable GLM for clinical variables with adjustment for demographic variables.  RESULTSWe identified 34,504 EMS encounters for patients with ED stroke diagnosis. Of these, 11,077 (32.1%) strokes had missed EMS stroke identification and instead had an EMS impression of ""Generalized Weakness"" (25.9%), ""Altered Level of Consciousness"" (24.9%), and ""Dizziness"" (7.2%). Patients more likely to have missed prehospital stroke identification were of Black race (p=0.0001) and Hispanic ethnicity (p=0.0001). Clinical variables associated with higher risk of missed EMS stroke identification were suspected alcohol or drug use (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.37-1.59), low GCS (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.10-1.24), tachycardia (RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.09), and hypotension (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.34-1.61).  CONCLUSIONSApproximately 1-in-3 patients transported by EMS did not have their stroke identified in the prehospital setting.

Urban rewilding and decomposing plant matter have been suggested to reverse this deprivation and support human health.  MethodsWe rewilded 21 urban private yards with vegetation and deadwood. Control yards (15) were analyzed for comparison. We collected microbial samples and used vegetation and deadwood inventories, landcover data and questionnaires to determine the effects of rewilding and living environment on skin and salivary microbiota, gene pathways and cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10). Samples were collected before the rewilding in summer and three months later in autumn.  FindingsRewilding preserved skin microbial richness in comparison to control group, including previously health-associated Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, despite the normal seasonal decline and less outdoor time in autumn. Deadwood abundance within 200-m radii associated directly to beta diversity of skin microbiota and Gammaproteobacterial taxonomies.  In saliva, deadwood was directly associated with the diversity of functional gene pathways, which in turn was negatively associated with pleiotropic IL-6 levels. Rewilding was associated with a decrease in L-histidine degradation and an increase in Mycobacteriaceae.  InterpretationSince both yard rewilding and neighborhood deadwood preserved rich commensal microbiota and reduced pro-inflammatory signals, decomposing plant matter, not just plant richness, seems to be crucial for ecosystem services that contribute to health. Since deadwood abundance was associated to reduced pro-inflammatory signals, it may be a suitable indicator of environment supporting immunological resilience.

The research addresses the critical need for accurate, real-time differentiation between cancerous and noncancerous brain tissue during neurosurgical procedures. The proposed method combines a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model, specifically DiNOV2, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) operating on Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture features. This dual-path architecture leverages both the global context capture capabilities of transformers and the local texture analysis strengths of GLCM + CNNs. The dataset comprised OCT images from 11 patients, with 5,831 B-frame slices used for training and validation, and 1,610 slices for testing. The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing cancerous from noncancerous tissue, with 99.7% {+/-} 0.1% accuracy on the training dataset, 99.4% {+/-} 0.1% on the validation dataset and 94.9% accuracy on the test dataset. This approach demonstrates significant potential for achieving and improving intraoperative decision-making in brain cancer surgeries, offering real-time, high-accuracy tissue classification and surgical guidance."

However, to date, the scheduling of OV therapy, with single versus multiple infusions on consecutive days, has not been correlated with immunological or clinical response. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, where the background liver is frequently chronically injured, repeated dosing may have deleterious implications, resulting in off-target immune-mediated damage, thereby tipping the balance between favourable clinical response and hepatotoxicity. As such, elucidation of the optimum dosing regime is necessary to ensure therapy, whilst limiting damage to the background liver.  MethodsHerein, we expand upon our previous experience in neoadjuvant OV therapy to compare the immunological response from single versus repeated doses of reovirus in cancer patients. The impact of OV immunotherapy on HCC outcomes was examined in vivo following a high fat diet or induced liver fibrosis in the context of an abnormal background liver. Furthermore, we assess, in a syngeneic model of HCC, the potential immune-mediated toxicity of single versus multiple virus infusions in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 blockade.  ResultsClinical trial data indicate that a single dose of reovirus is equivalent or superior to repeat doses in achieving: (a) induction of an inflammatory cytokine/chemokine response; (b) peripheral blood immune cell activation; and (c) migration of activated CD8+ CTLs. Repeated doses on consecutive days do not improve the amplitude or duration of the immune response following virus infusion. Furthermore, repeated viral dosing leads to an unwanted influx of activated T cells into background liver. An increase in PD-L1 expression on T cells resulting from a single virus dose was observed. Combination therapy of reovirus plus anti-PD-L1, but not anti-PD-1, limited tumour growth and extended survival in vivo.  ConclusionsA single dose of oncolytic virus is equivalent or superior to multiple consecutive doses in inducing an anti-tumour immune response. Combination immune checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-L1 holds potential to maximise the beneficial effects of a single dose, whilst simultaneously avoiding undesirable toxicities in the background liver in the context of HCC."

However, fall patients are often coded using subsequent injury codes, such as hip fractures. This necessitates manual screening to ensure the accuracy of data registries. Herein, we aimed to automate the extraction of fall incidents and mechanisms using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and compare this approach with the ICD method.  MethodsClinical notes for patients with fall-induced hip fractures were retrospectively reviewed by medical experts. Fall incidences were detected, annotated, and classified among patients who had fall-induced hip fracture (case group). The control group included patients with hip fracture without any evidence of fall. NLP models were developed using the annotated notes of the study groups to fulfill two separate tasks: fall occurrence detection and fall mechanism classification. The performances of the models were compared using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).  ResultsA total of 1,769 clinical notes were included in the final analysis for the fall occurrence task, and 783 clinical notes were analyzed for the fall mechanism classification task. The highest F1 score using NLP for fall occurrence was 0.97 (specificity=0.96; sensitivity=0.97) and for fall mechanism classification was 0.61 (specificity=0.56; sensitivity=0.62). NLP could detect up to 98% of the fall occurrences and 65% of the fall mechanisms accurately compared to 26% and 12%, respectively, by ICD codes.  ConclusionOur findings showed promising performance with a higher accuracy of NLP algorithms compared to the conventional method for detecting fall occurrence and mechanism in developing disease registries using clinical notes. Our approach can be introduced to other registries that are based on large data and are in need for accurate annotation and classification."

ObjectiveTo evaluate the performance of our Comparative Analysis of RNA Expression (CARE) pipeline in nominating druggable targets in pediatric patients with difficult-to-treat or rare cancers.  Design, Setting, and ParticipantsOur cohort study, the Comparative Analysis of RNA Expression to Improve Pediatric and Young Adult Cancer Treatment (CARE IMPACT), was conducted collaboratively by the UC Santa Cruz Treehouse Childhood Cancer Initiative and Stanford University School of Medicine. From June 4, 2018, to September 24, 2020, UCSC Treehouse obtained and processed RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data for 35 tumor samples from 33 children and young adults with a relapsed, refractory or rare cancer. Each tumor RNA-Seq dataset underwent CARE analysis to reveal activated cancer driver pathways and nominate treatment options. We compare the CARE pipeline to other gene expression outlier detection approaches and discuss challenges and opportunities for the clinical implementation of RNA-Seq-based gene expression outlier detection for pediatric cancer patients.  ExposuresPatients underwent tumor RNA-Seq analysis and standard-of-care tumor DNA profiling.

Its risk factors include rare and highly penetrant somatic mutations. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also identified four common inherited variants associated with AML risk, but these findings have not yet been confirmed in many independent datasets. Here, we performed a replication study with 567 AML cases from the Leucegene cohort and 1,865 controls from the population-based cohort CARTaGENE (CaG). Because genotypes were generated using different technologies in the two datasets (e.g. low- vs. high-coverage whole-genome sequencing), we applied stringent quality-control filters to minimize type I errors. We showed using data reduction methods (e.g. principal component analysis [PCA] and uniform manifold approximation and projection [UMAP]) that our approach successfully integrated the Leucegene and CaG genetic data. We replicated the association between cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML and rs3916765, a variant located near HLA-DQA2 (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.88 [1.21-2.93], P- value=0.005). The effect size of this association was stronger when we restricted the analyses to AML patients with NPM1 mutations (odds ratios >2.35). We found HLA- DOB to be the most significantly upregulated gene in Leucegene participants with the CN-AML protective A-allele at rs3916765. We further found that several HLA class II genes are also differentially expressed albeit at lower statistical significance. Our results confirm that a common genetic variant at the HLA locus associates with AML risk, providing new opportunities to improve disease prognosis and treatment."

Using haplotypes derived from whole genome sequencing, we identified a region on chromosome 11 that is associated with inherited differences in mPAS staining. Of the genes in this region, only NXPE1 haplotypes correlated perfectly with mPAS staining in the original cohort used for whole genome sequencing, as well as in a validation cohort. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that one common allele of NXPE1, with a single base pair substitution in its promoter region, greatly reduces expression of the gene. Genetic manipulation of NXPE1 expression confirmed this conclusion and caused changes to modified sialic acid levels. Finally, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) confirms that enzymatically active NXPE1 is capable of transferring an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to sialic acid in vitro.

MethodsWe leveraged data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) to assess four CHD-PRS from the PGS catalog, derived using multiple methods (LDpred, AnnoPred, stacked clumping and thresholding, and LDPred2). We evaluated associations between each standardized PRS and time to adjudicated incident MI, adjusted for age, sex, first 5 principal components, and weighted for survey design. Concordance statistics (c-index) compared predictive accuracy of each PRS with, and in addition to, traditional risk factors (TRF) for CHD (obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking). Analyses were stratified by self-reported Caribbean- (Puerto Rican, Dominican or Cuban) and Mainland- (those of Mexican, Central American, or South American) heritage subgroups.  ResultsAfter 11 years follow-up, for 9055 participants (mean age (SD) 47.6(13.1), 62.2% female), the incidence of MI was 1.0% (n = 95).

Expert inspection of a 12- lead clinical electrocardiogram (ECG) or a Holter record is the standard approach for detecting WPW syndrome. Smartwatches that acquire lead-I ECGs can enable automated detection of WPW episodes in out-of-hospital settings and prevent adverse outcomes. In this work, we explore deep-learning solutions to identify WPW syndromes on lead-I ECG. Scarcity of labeled ECG data for WPW and other cardiac conduction disorders poses a major challenge for training data-driven methods. Moreover, generalizability of such methods to external patient population remains unexplored. To address these challenges, first we implement and compare multiple existing strategies from time-domain augmentations on the lead-I ECG to transfer learning of Imagenet-models for ECG wavelet transformations. Training and holdout validation of these methods are conducted using about 14,000 ECGs from PTB-XL, a publicly available ECG dataset. Moreover, we explore generalization of these methods by external validation on the data from 140 patients from the Tongji Hospital ECG Database. While these methods achieve 88% sensitivity and 99% specificity in identifying a lead-I ECG with evident WPW, and an area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) of 0.99 on the holdout set from PTB-XL, the sensitivity drops to 58% with an AUC of 0.88 on the external validation. Finally, we propose a novel data augmentation strategy by incorporating labeled data from an umbrella super-class of cardiac conduction disorders, instead of WPW alone, thus naturally reducing the data imbalance for model training. We apply these models as zero-shot transfer learning for discriminating WPW from normal ECG. While this approach achieves similar performance during holdout validation, it also demonstrates strong performance on the external Tongji dataset with sensitivity 0.78 and AUC 0.91. This result shows significant generalizability of the proposed method and highlights the potential of deep-learning solutions in monitoring WPW syndrome with lead-I ECG in outof-hospital general populace settings."

However, it is difficult to deliver ablation catheters to the distal vessels and their branches. In small vessels, the energy released is limited, and the risk of ablation is increased. The objective of this study was to design a linear catheter with pulsed field energy that is suitable for ablation in the distal vessels and to verify its efficacy and safety in canines.  MethodsA total of eight canines were randomly assigned to two observation groups: a 48-hour group (N=4) and a 30-day group (N=4). A 3 F 10-pole pulsed field ablation catheter was employed to ablate in the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the anterior interventricular vein, and the distal small branches of the cardiac venous system. The characteristics of the ablation lesions were observed both grossly and microscopically.  ResultsThe surgical procedure was completed successfully. Pulsed field energy can travel through the fatty tissue to form a lesion in the cardiomyocytes. The mean depth of the lesion in the 30-day group (2.37{+/-}0.53 mm) was found to be reduced by 39% (P<0.001) in comparison to that observed in the 48-hour group (3.92{+/-}0.62 mm). Additionally, a transition zone of incomplete injury was discerned in the junction area of the 48-hour group. Canines exhibited no adverse effects intraoperatively nor postoperatively, and no appreciable damage was observed in the adjacent small arteries or the surrounding organs.  ConclusionThe pulsed field energy from small blood vessels can cause lasting, continuous lesions to the myocardium and is safe to use. The 3 F liner pulsed field ablation catheter has been proven to be efficacious and safe, with promising indications for future application."

However, there is limited data regarding the impact of pruritus on cancer and mortality in patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis.  ObjectiveTo investigate the associations of pruritus to cancer and mortality in patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis.  MethodsThis nationwide, population-based retrospective cohort study included adult dermatomyositis and polymyositis patients from Taiwans National Health Insurance Research Database between 2005 and 2022. Sex- and age-matched pruritic patients, identified by over six weeks of antipruritic medication use, and nonpruritic patients were analyzed. The primary outcome was cancer occurrence or all-cause mortality.  ResultsAmong 919 matched pairs of pruritic and non-pruritic patients, cancer was observed in 19.96% in the long-term pruritic group, 14.63% in the short-term pruritic group, and 10.34% in the nonpruritic group (p<0.0001). All-cause mortality was documented at 30.37% in the long-term pruritic group, 29.69% in the short-term pruritic group, and 37.76% in the nonpruritic group (p<0.0001). Pruritus was associated with an increased risk of cancer (hazard ratio 1.492, 95% confidence interval 1.093-2.036), and a lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.489, 95% confidence interval 0.419-0.571).  ConclusionThis population-based study revealed pruritus appeared to be associated with increased cancer risk and decreased all-cause mortality. Thus, pruritus may serve as a pragmatic factor for risk stratification and tailored treatment strategies in dermatomyositis and polymyositis. Comprehensive cancer screening is recommended for patients with dermatomyositis or polymyositis, particularly those presenting with pruritus, whereas patients without pruritus may require vigilant management for potentially life-threatening complications and comorbidities.

Findings from a qualitative study of UK emergency services,"['Fiona C. Sampson.', 'Rachel O’Hara.', 'Jaqui Long.', 'Joanne Coster.']",Fiona C Sampson (f.c.sampson@sheffield.ac.uk),"['1 SCHARR, School of Medicine and Population Health, University of Sheffield , S1 4DA, UK']","ObjectivesPre-hospital notifications (pre-alerts) enable Emergency Department (ED) staff to prepare for the arrival of patients requiring a time-critical response. Effective communication of the pre-alert is key to enabling the ED to prepare appropriately but evidence on communication practices is lacking. We undertook qualitative research to understand how pre-alert communication may be improved to optimise the ED response for pre-alerted patients.  Design, setting and participantsData collection took place within three UK Ambulance Services and six EDs between August 2022-April 2023. We undertook semi-structured interviews with 34 ambulance and 40 ED staff and 156 hours non-participation observation of pre-alert practice (143 pre-alerts). Verbatim interview transcripts and observation notes were imported into NVivo and analysed using a thematic approach.  ResultsWe identified significant variation in how pre-alerts were communicated that influenced how effectively information was transferred. Ambulance and ED staff demonstrated a shared recognition that pre-alerts need to be communicated concisely, but both received minimal training in how to give and receive pre-alerts. Efficient pre-alerting was influenced by clinician experience and seniority. ED and ambulance clinicians following different information sharing formats (e.g. ATMIST, SBAR) sometimes led to interruptions, information loss and tensions, particularly when an early  headline clinical concern had not been shared. Ambulance clinicians sometimes questioned the appropriateness of their pre-alert when ED clinicians did not explain the rationale for not giving the expected response (i.e. being accepted into a high-priority area of ED). Additional sources of frustration included technological problems and poor communication of ETA and caller/responder identities.  ConclusionsUse of shared format including a headline  cause for concern may improve the clarity, usefulness and civility of pre-alerts, particularly when the clinician concern is not obvious from observations. Basic training on how to undertake pre-alerts for both ED and ambulance clinicians may improve understanding of the importance of pre-alert communication.  Strengths and limitations of the studyO_LIThis study triangulated findings from Emergency Department staff and Ambulance Clinicians from across three Ambulance Service regions in England to provide insights into the causes of incivility relating to pre-alert communications.

Both of these diseases may occur due to abrupt DNA methylation of genes. Likewise, both diseases may occur in a patient due to protein misfolding. Our study proposes a novel framework for building two disease-specific heterogeneous networks by integrating different tissue-based transcriptomics, epigenetics, epistasis, and PPI-based topological information. We predict the missing links between the DNA methylation and Post-Translational Modification (PTMs) associated with protein aggregation. Next, we have predicted the common signature of the prevalence of linked patterns in both diseases, further validated by relevant biological evidence."

Global need is rising, with the greatest burden in low-and-middle-income countries. This is especially true in Nigeria where the need is growing rapidly, as are PC services; however, current organizational models have not yet been examined.  MethodsThis was a cross-sectional, descriptive study of five PC sites at tertiary hospitals in four of Nigerias six geopolitical zones. Surveys, informed by a Centre for Palliative Care, Nigeria (CPCN) needs assessment checklist and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), were administered at each site to leadership, frontline workers, patients, and caregivers. Surveys varied by participant group and inquired about organizational models and personal experiences of both providers and recipients of care.  ResultsAcross five sites, there was a total of 282 survey respondents: five leaders, nine frontline workers, 132 patients, and 136 caregivers. The most common diagnoses of PC patients were cancer, sickle cell disease, and HIV. Most sites reported sub-optimal administrative support (80%), hospital management support (60%), and building space (60%). Leadership responses highlighted variations in PC training requirements and opportunities. Frontline workers desired additional training, sponsorship, and governmental support. Most patients and their caregivers reported satisfaction with PC, though high levels of worry and hopelessness were reported.  ConclusionIncreased organizational support appears necessary to facilitate improvements in administrative resources, staffing, and training. Emotional and spiritual wellbeing likely require prioritization when designing palliative care delivery services in Nigeria. Further research is needed to refine current services and inform implementation efforts."

However, research on domain-specific memory impairments in bipolar mania is limited, especially in the Indian subcontinent. This study aimed to assess memory impairments in patients with bipolar mania using the Postgraduate Institute Memory (PGI-Memory) Scale and to highlight domain-specific deficits compared to healthy controls.  MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted at Tertiary Care Centre in North India. Twenty patients diagnosed with bipolar mania and twenty age, sex and education-matched healthy controls between age 18 to 40 were recruited. Memory functions were assessed using the PGI-Memory scale, focusing on immediate, recent, remote, long-term memory, and associative memory. Mental control and working memory were also evaluated.  ResultsBoth groups were matched in terms of age, sex, and education. the mean (sd) age for bipolar mania group was 27.2 (4.14) years. Patients with bipolar mania demonstrated significant deficits in various memory domains, including immediate, recent, remote, long-term, and associative memory, as well as in visual reproduction and recognition tasks. In contrast, their working memory performance was comparable to that of the control group. The largest deficits were observed in long-term memory (d =2.37) and visual reproduction (d=2.30).  ConclusionsBipolar mania is associated with widespread memory impairments, particularly in long-term and associative memory, which may contribute to difficulties in emotional regulation and daily functioning. These findings emphasize the importance of considering memory impairments in the diagnosis and management of BPAD. Further studies are required to investigate the neurobiological foundations of these impairments and to develop specific interventions."

This landscape review evaluated how data related to maternal and neonatal health is recorded and utilized for clinical and policy decision-making in the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania.  MethodThis landscape review employed a dual method approach, initially quantifying data recording practices of each clinic and then using qualitative interviews to explore how data is currently captured and utilized. We conducted interviewed with seven Nurse-Midwives, eight Lead Obstetricians at district hospitals, seven District Medical Officers, and seven District Reproductive and Child Health Coordinators. Qualitative data analysis was performed using NVivo software.  ResultsIn the regions seven districts, there are 489 healthcare facilities offering Reproductive and Child Health Services, delivery, infant and child care. The facilities comprise 22 hospitals, 62 health centers, 353 dispensaries, and 52 clinics. In 2021, there were 45,343 births with a maternal mortality rate of 146 per 100,000 live births, a neonatal mortality rate of 10.1 per 1,000 live births, and a stillbirth rate of 4 per 1,000 births. Additionally, 20.3% of births were delivered via C-section.  Although there was a notable decline in maternal and neonatal mortality rates (from 112 to 51 vs 9.5 to 3.7 deaths per 100,000 live births) from 2020 to 2023, the 2021 data revealed unexpectedly high maternal mortality rates. The qualitative study highlighted issues with the data recording system, which is complex and time-consuming, involving multiple paper-based and digital records. Challenges include data volume, loss, and retrieval issues, affecting clinical decision-making. This data is crucial for identifying resource needs, monitoring health trends like low antenatal care uptake, and advocating for changes in resources, guidelines, and policies at regional and national levels.  ConclusionQuantitative data indicates a significant rise in maternal and neonatal mortality rates in the Kilimanjaro region during 2020-2021, followed by a decrease in 2022-2023. Additionally, early antenatal care (ANC) uptake remains below 50%.

MethodsA one-year decision tree-based cost-effectiveness model was developed, considering three scenarios: no Fall 2023 vaccination, BNT162b2 vaccination and mRNA-1273 vaccination in the COVID-19 high-risk population in the Netherlands. The high-risk population includes everyone of 60 and older, and younger adults at high risk as identified by the Dutch Health Council. Costs were included from a societal perspective and the modelled period started in October 2023 and ended in September 2024, including life years lost with a lifetime horizon. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate model robustness.  ResultsIn the base case, mRNA-1273 demonstrated substantial benefits over BNT162b2, potentially averting 20,629 symptomatic cases, 924 hospitalizations (including 32 ICU admissions), 207 deaths, and 2,124 post-COVID cases. Societal cost savings were {euro}12.9million (excluding vaccination costs), with 1,506 QALYs gained. The break-even incremental price of mRNA-1273 compared to BNT162b2 was {euro}16.72 or {euro}34.32 considering a willingness to pay threshold (WTP) of 20,000 or 50,000 euro per QALY gained.  ConclusionThis study provides a comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis supporting the adoption of the mRNA-1273 vaccine in the national immunization programme in the Netherlands, provided that the Dutch government negotiates a vaccine price that is at most {euro}34.32 per dose higher than BNT162b2. Despite limitations, the findings emphasize the substantial health and economic benefits of mRNA-1273 over BNT162b2 in the high-risk population."

However, large-scale, real-world data on mental health care utilization and associated factors among PLWH remain limited. This study leveraged electronic health records (EHR) and Basics survey data from the All of Us program to explore mental health care utilization and associated factors among PLWH during the COVID-19 pandemic.  MethodsUsing a retrospective cohort design, we identified and included 4,575 PLWH through computational phenotyping based on relevant Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) concept sets from the All of Us program between March 2018 and March 2022. Mental health care utilization was measured using the yearly count of mental health care visits over this period. The pattern of mental health care utilization was compared between pre-pandemic (2018-2020) and during the pandemic (2020-2022). Incidence rate ratios (IRR) from the Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to examine associations between mental health care utilization, history of COVID-19 infection, demographic factors, pre-existing chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and socioeconomic status.  ResultsAmong 4,575 PLWH, the annual number of mental health care visits decreased significantly during the pandemic period (March 2020 - March 2022) compared to the pre-pandemic period (March 2018 - February 2020) (IRR = 0.89, p < 0.001). The Poisson regression analysis found that a history of COVID-19 infection was associated with a higher number of mental health care visits (IRR = 1.35, p < 0.001). Middle-aged groups with participants aged 30-39 (IRR= 2.35, p = 0.002), 40-49 (IRR= 3.49, p < 0.001), and 50-64 (IRR= 2.07, p = 0.004) had significantly higher visit numbers compared to the youngest group (18-29 years). Black or African American participants were less likely to have visits compared to White participants (IRR = 0.71, p = 0.002). Medicaid health insurance was associated with an increase (IRR = 1.29, p = 0.007), while employer- or union-sponsored insurance was associated with a decrease in mental health care utilization (IRR = 0.54, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). Pre-existing comorbidities greatly increased the number of mental health care visits (one comorbidity: IRR = 5.49, two or more: IRR = 10.4, p < 0.001).  ConclusionOur study reveals a significant decrease in mental health care utilization and the diverse experiences of mental healthcare among PLWH during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings underscore the importance of addressing disparities in mental health care access, particularly during public health emergencies, and suggest the need for tailored interventions to meet the mental health care needs of PLWH.  Key PointsO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSHow did the COVID-19 pandemic affect mental health care utilization among people living with HIV (PLWH)? What are the factors associated with mental care health utilization among PLWH across both the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods?  FindingsReal-world data from a nationwide cohort of 4,575 PLWH identified from the All of Us program in the United States between March 2018 and March 2022 were used to investigate the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care utilization (i.e., the yearly count of mental healthcare visits). There was a considerable decrease in mental health care utilization during the pandemic (2020-2022) compared to the pre-pandemic period (2018-2020). Factors associated with higher mental health care utilization during the pandemic were the experience of COVID-19 infection, being middle-aged, Medicaid health coverage, and having comorbidities. Black African American participants, those with employer- or union health insurance, and high annual income (>$35,000), had lower mental health care utilization.  MeaningOur study highlights the diverse and unequal experiences of PLWH during the pandemic, with variations in mental health care utilization over time and across different disadvantaged subgroups. These findings underscore the need for timely and targeted mental health care services and delivery in future public health crises."

A better understanding of its neurobiological underpinnings will benefit the prevention of smoking-related illnesses and mortality. Recent neuroimaging studies have identified a correlation between smoking and iron concentration in the brains striatum, a subcortical region involved in habit formation and compulsive behaviour, and a central node of dopamine activity. Moreover, iron accumulation in the striatum is associated with lower cognitive performance in adults. Here, we investigated phenotypic and genetic correlations, and causal relationships between smoking initiation (ever smoked regularly) and susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived markers of iron content-T2* and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM)-in the bilateral putamen, caudate, and accumbens nuclei. We computed correlations between smoking and striatal iron in the UK Biobank, adjusting for a vast set of imaging and non-imaging confounders. Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary statistics, we performed global genetic correlation, cross-GWAS coherence tests at the gene level, and causality analysis using Mendelian randomisation and PascalX. Smoking was positively correlated with iron content in the bilateral putamen, caudate, and in the left accumbens, with the strongest effect found when contrasting current and never smokers. Striatal iron had a positive association with pack-years and a negative relationship with years since stopping smoking, indicating a possible reversal of iron accumulation after smoking cessation. Genetic correlation paralleled phenotypic correlation. Cross-GWAS signal was coherent in genes involved in the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems, and synaptic function. There was evidence of a causal relationship from smoking to striatal iron through genes involved in synaptogenesis and plasticity, and to a lesser extent, from striatal iron to smoking through inflammatory and immune system related genes. Moreover, the heterogeneity of genes with correlated and anti-correlated signals suggests that the neurobiological mechanisms linking iron to smoking behaviour are highly complex. Overall our results show an association between cigarette smoking and iron concentration in the striatum with complex multi-directional causal mechanisms involving synaptic transmission and inflammatory circuits."

Mutations in the tumor-suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 significantly increase the risk of developing cancer, with the probability rising by more than 50%. Identifying pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 is crucial for both diagnosis and treatment. Targeted panels, which focus on medically relevant subsets of genes, have become essential tools in precision oncology. Beyond technical and human resource factors, standardized bioinformatics workflows are essential for the accurate interpretation of results. We developed a robust bioinformatics pipeline, implemented with Nextflow, to process sequencing data from targeted panels to identify germline variants.  ResultsWe developed an automated and reproducible pipeline using Nextflow for the targeted sequencing of BRCA1/2 genes. The pipeline incorporates two variant callers, Strelka and DeepVariant, both of which have demonstrated high performance in detecting germline SNVs and indels. The runtime is efficient, with a median execution time of less than 3 minutes per task. We sequenced and processed 16 samples from breast cancer patients. In our analysis, we identified 8 nonsynonymous mutations in BRCA1 and 9 in BRCA2. Of the total reported germline mutations, 97% were classified as benign, 1% as pathogenic, 1% as of uncertain significance, and 1% as unknown. The allelic frequencies observed in our cohort closely resemble those of Admixed American and South Asian populations, with the greatest divergence observed in comparison to African individuals.  ConclusionWe successfully analyzed the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 16 breast cancer patients at a public hospital in Chile. A custom Nextflow pipeline was developed to process the sequencing data and evaluate the pathological significance of the identified genetic variants. By employing multiple variant-calling methodologies, we were able to detect and mitigate potential false positives, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of variant detection through cross-verification. A pathogenic variant was identified in one patient, while benign or likely benign variants were found in the remaining 15. Expanding the number of oncogenes sequenced per patient could improve the detection of actionable variants."

Loss of activity of the IBD susceptibility gene, protein tyrosine phosphatase type 2 (PTPN2), results in dysbiosis of the gut microbiota both in human subjects and mice. Further, constitutive Ptpn2 knock-out (Ptpn2-KO) mice display expansion of AIEC compared to wildtype littermates. CEACAM6, a host cell surface glycoprotein, is exploited by AIEC to attach to and enter intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Here, we investigate the role of IEC-specific PTPN2 in restricting AIEC invasion. Methods: Biopsies from IBD patients heterozygous (CT) or homozygous (CC) for the PTPN2 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) rs1893217 were processed for immunohistochemistry. HT29 intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) were transfected with control shRNA (PTPN2-CTL), or a shRNA targeted towards PTPN2 (PTPN2-KD). The rs1893217 SNP was inserted (PTPN2-KI), or a complete knock-out of PTPN2 (PTPN2-KO) was generated, with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of Caco-2BBe IEC lines. Adherence and invasion assays were performed with either the human IBD AIEC isolate, LF82, or a novel fluorescent-tagged mouse adherent invasive E. coli (mAIECred) at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. IL-6 and the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib were administered to interrogate JAK-STAT signaling. Protein expression was determined by western blotting and densitometry. Results: CEACAM6 expression was elevated (colon and ileum) in IBD patients carrying the PTPN2 rs1893217 SNP (CT, CC) compared to wildtype (TT) IBD patients. HT29 and Caco-2BBe cell lines deficient in PTPN2 expressed significantly higher levels of CEACAM6. Further, PTPN2-KI and PTPN2-KO cell lines also displayed greater adherence and invasion by AIEC LF82 and higher mAIECred invasion. CEACAM6 expression was further elevated after administration of IL-6 in PTPN2-deficient cell lines compared to untreated controls. Silencing of STAT1 and 3 partially reduced CEACAM6 protein expression. Tofacitinib significantly reduced the elevated CEACAM6 protein expression and the higher AIEC adherence and invasion in PTPN2-KI and PTPN2-KO cell lines compared to DMSO controls. Conclusion: Our findings highlight a crucial role for PTPN2 in restricting pathobiont entry into host cells. Our study also describes a role for the FDA-approved drug, tofacitinib (Xeljanz) in correcting the JAK-STAT-mediated overexpression of CEACAM6, used by pathobionts as an entry portal into host cells. These findings suggest a role for JAK-inhibitors in mitigating AIEC colonization in IBD susceptible hosts."

Identifying how NPS cluster in bvFTD may clarify the underlying neurobiology of bvFTD-related NPS and guide development of therapies. Methodology: Participants (N=354) with sporadic and genetic bvFTD were enrolled in the ARTFL LEFFTDS Longitudinal Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration Consortium. Dementia stage was defined as early (CDR plus NACC FTLD) or advanced (CDR plus NACC FTLD). Baseline and annual follow-up visit data were analyzed to compare NPS across stages of bvFTD. Psychiatric states were captured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire and Clinician Judgement of Symptoms. Polychoric cluster analysis was used to describe NPS clusters. Results: NPS were highly prevalent (> 90%) in early and late bvFTD. Four NPS clusters were identified based on magnitude of factor loadings: affective, disinhibited, compulsive, and psychosis. Neuropsychiatric symptoms fluctuated across visits. In the affective cluster, depression and anxiety showed the least visit-to-visit stability. In the disinhibited cluster, elation showed the least stability. Symptoms in the psychosis and compulsive clusters (hallucinations, delusions, obsessions/compulsions, and hyperorality) were largely stable, persisting from visit-to-visit in more than 50% of cases. Conclusion: NPS in bvFTD are frequent and cluster into four discrete groups in bvFTD. These clusters may result from specific neural network disruptions that could serve as targets for future interventions. The fluctuating nature of NPS in bvFTD suggests that they are not reliable markers of disease progression or stage."

Automated segmentation of brainstem arousal nuclei is an essential step toward elucidating the physiology of arousal in human consciousness and the pathophysiology of disorders of consciousness. We created a probabilistic atlas of brainstem arousal nuclei built on diffusion MRI scans of five ex vivo human brain specimens scanned at 750 micron isotropic resolution. Labels of arousal nuclei used to generate the probabilistic atlas were manually annotated with reference to nucleus-specific immunostaining in two of the five brain specimens. We then developed a Bayesian segmentation algorithm that utilizes the probabilistic atlas as a generative model and automatically identifies brainstem arousal nuclei in a resolution- and contrast-agnostic manner. The segmentation method displayed high accuracy in both healthy and lesioned in vivo T1 MRI scans and high test-retest reliability across both T1 and T2 MRI contrasts. Finally, we show that the segmentation algorithm can detect volumetric changes and differences in magnetic susceptibility within brainstem arousal nuclei in Alzheimer's disease and traumatic coma, respectively.

We found convergence between genes within the same biological pathway and convergence between common and rare variants within the same gene. Seven of the genes associated with total or regional brain volume measures were also linked with rare brain disorders in previous literature. We successfully showed that rare variants in genes linked to rare brain disorders were also associated with sub-clinical brain volume variation."

Chan', 'Colin Hong', 'Rakesh Joshi']",Rakesh Joshi (rakesh@skinopathy.com),"['Skinopathy Research, Skinopathy Inc.']","The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized for its potential to enhance various aspects of healthcare, including patient care, medical research, and education. The well-known LLM from Open AI: ChatGPT, a user-friendly GPT-4 based chatbot, has become increasingly popular. However, current limitations to LLMs, such as hallucinations, outdated information, and ethical and legal complications may pose significant risks to patients and contribute to the spread of medical disinformation. This study focuses on the application of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to mitigate common limitations of LLMs like ChatGPT and assess its effectiveness in summarizing and organizing medical information. Up-to-date clinical guidelines were utilized as the source of information to create detailed medical templates. These were evaluated against human-generated templates by a panel of physicians, using Likert scales for accuracy and usefulness, and programmatically using BERTScores for textual similarity. The LLM templates scored higher on average for both accuracy and usefulness when compared to human-generated templates. BERTScore analysis further showed high textual similarity between ChatGPT- and Human-generated templates. These results indicate that RAG-enhanced LLM prompting can effectively summarize and organize medical information, demonstrating high potential for use in clinical settings."

Deploying these models at scale can be challenging due to high computational costs, regulatory constraints, and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we used synthetic data distillation to fine-tune smaller, open-source LLMs that achieve performance similar to that of larger models, including the teacher model. These smaller models can be run on less expensive local hardware or at a vastly reduced cost in cloud deployments. In this study, we used Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct to generate synthetic training examples in the form of question-answer pairs along with supporting information and model-assigned difficulty scores. These synthetic examples were used to fine-tune the smaller Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model. We evaluated the performance of these models on an annotated synthetic dataset resembling clinical trial criteria, the i2b2 2018 Clinical Trial Eligibility Challenge, and clinical notes reflecting the clinical trial for apixaban. The fine-tuned models outperformed the 8B-Instruct model on all tasks and in some cases even exceeded the performance of the larger 70B-Instruct model. This work demonstrates the potential of synthetic data distillation to enable more scalable and efficient clinical information extraction, which could be applied toward improving accuracy and efficiency of patient phenotyping and clinical-trial matching."

Decentralizing care could improve this situation but may necessitate substantial changes in the healthcare system. This study assessed the available resources, and healthcare professionals' knowledge and skills across Southern Ethiopia's healthcare facilities to inform decentralization plans. Methodology/Principle findings: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May to July 2023 in Gamo Zone, South Ethiopia, including visits to 11 health centers, 4 primary hospitals, and 1 general hospital. Available resources were evaluated, and clinical and laboratory staff's knowledge and skills were tested through questionnaires focused on CL and other skin diseases. Most facilities had equipment for diagnosis and localized treatment. Adequate hospitalization space and necessary equipment for systemic CL treatment were found in 3 out of 4 primary hospitals but none of the health centers. Consumable and drug shortages were common across all facilities. BSc laboratory technologists scored significantly higher than diploma technicians (29 vs. 15 out of 39, p<0.001). Clinical staff scores varied significantly across education levels (p=0.007), with clinicians scoring the highest (median 33, IQR 31-36), followed by health officers (median 29, IQR 27-32), BSc nurses (median 28, IQR 16-36) and diploma nurses (median 25, IQR 19-29). Notably, no significant differences in median scores were observed between primary hospitals and health centers for both clinical and laboratory staff. Conclusions/Significance: Decentralizing diagnosis and treatment of common skin diseases and localized CL treatment to health centers appears feasible with facility adjustments and continuous staff training. CL cases requiring systemic treatment should be referred to primary hospitals. Strategic efforts to enhance and maintain skills and tackle supply shortages are crucial for successful decentralization."

This study evaluated the diagnostic validity of the parent-reported ARFID-Brief Screener in preschool children and examined prevalence and clinical characteristics of ARFID. Method: Parents of 645 children (50.5% male, mean age 3.2 years) completed the ARFID-Brief Screener in connection with the 2.5- and 4-year routine check-ups at 21 child health services centers in West Sweden. Parents of all screen-positive and of randomly selected screen-negative children were invited to a clinical follow-up interview via phone. Co-occurring neurodevelopmental problems were assessed via questionnaire, clinical examination, and health care records. Results: Of 42 (6.5%) children screening positive for ARFID, 29 were followed up via interview, and ARFID diagnosis was confirmed in 21 (positive predicted value 72%; other diagnostic metrics: negative predictive value 94%, sensitivity 91%, specificity 79%, and overall accuracy 84%. The adjusted prevalence of ARFID was 5.9%. All children with ARFID presented with both sensory-based avoidance and low interest, and the majority (65.2%) met criteria solely through DSM-5 criterion A4 (marked interference with psychosocial functioning). The ARFID group had significantly more co-occurring neurodevelopmental problems. Discussion: ARFID is not rare among preschoolers, although prevalence might have been slightly overestimated here. The ARFID-Brief Screener showed high diagnostic validity, but follow-up assessments are necessary to confirm diagnoses and reduce false positives. Co-occurring neurodevelopmental problems were common in ARFID and may serve as early markers of increased ARFID risk."

Therefore, this study investigated longitudinal interrelations between clinical outcomes, brain structure, and somatic health in post-acute individuals from the schizophrenia spectrum. Methods: A sample of 63 post-acute patients from two independent physical exercise studies were included in the final analyses. Demographic, clinical, cognitive, and somatic data were acquired at baseline and post-intervention, as were structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Multivariate cross-lagged panel modelling including mediators was used to study the mutual interrelations over time between the clinical, neural, and somatic level. Results: A higher baseline global grey matter volume and larger regional grey matter volumes of the hippocampal formation, precuneus, and posterior cingulate drove improvements in multiple clinical outcomes, such as daily-life functioning, negative symptoms, and cognition. Increases in white matter volume from baseline to post-intervention resulted in significantly reduced positive symptoms and higher daily-life functioning following the intervention. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that stimulating neuroplasticity, especially in the hippocampal formation, precuneus, and posterior cingulate gyrus, may represent a promising treatment target in post-acute schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Physical exercise therapies and other lifestyle interventions, and brain stimulation approaches reflect promising treatment candidates. Given the exploratory character of the statistical analysis performed, these findings need to be replicated in independent longitudinal imaging cohorts of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders."

It risks detention or deportation, and hinders access to basic services including healthcare. This study aimed to examined the association between legal residency status and health of Syrian refugees living in Lebanon. Methods: Data were from two independent nested cross-sectional studies collected in 2022 through telephone surveys. In the first study, all Syrian refugees aged 50 years or older from households that received humanitarian assistance were invited to participate. The second included all adult Syrian refugees residing in a suburb of Beirut. The exposure was self-reported possession of a legal residency permit in Lebanon. The self-reported health outcomes were mental health status, COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and access to the needed healthcare services. Separate adjusted logistic regression models examined the association between lacking a legal residency permit and each health outcome. Results: The first sample included 3357 participants (median age 58 years (IQR:54-64), 47% female), of whom 85% reported lacking a legal residency permit. The second sample included 730 participants (median age 34 years (IQR:26-42), 49% female), of whom 79% lacked a legal residency permit. In both studies, lacking a legal residency permit increased the odds of having poor mental health [adjusted odds ratio (aOR):1.62 (95%CI:1.2-2.2); aOR:1.62 (95%CI:1.01-2.60)], and decreased the odds of COVID-19 vaccine uptake [aOR:0.64 (95%CI:0.53-0.78); aOR:0.51 (95%CI:0.32-0.81)]. In the sub-sample who needed primary healthcare, lacking a legal residency permit decreased the odds of access to primary healthcare in the second study only (aOR:0.37 (95%CI:0.17-0.84)). Conclusions: The majority of Syrian refugees from these two samples reported lacking a legal residency permit in Lebanon. This was associated with poor mental health and lower uptake of COVID-19 vaccination, potentially originating from fear of detention or deportation. These findings call for urgent action to support access to legal documentation for refugees in Lebanon."

PC defines the limits for PA, while activities in daily life typically remain submaximal. Individuals whose intensity of daily activities is close to physical capacity may be better protected from future decline in physical function compared to those who do not, although prospective research to support this hypothesis is lacking. Therefore, this study compared changes in physical function over a four-year follow-up between community-dwelling older adults categorized based on their combined baseline PC and PA. METHODS: This was a four-year longitudinal follow-up study of older adults aged 75-85 years at baseline (N = 312, 60% women). Baseline PC was determined based on 5-second Mean Amplitude Deviation (MAD) epoch value during the maximal 10-meter walking test, and PA was determined based on the peak 75-minutes MAD intensity threshold from thigh-worn accelerometer monitoring over 3-7 days. Baseline values of PA and PC were categorized into lowPC-lowPA, lowPC-highPA, highPC-lowPA, and highPC-highPA profiles. Physical function was evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) at baseline and at the follow-up, with total score and 5 x Sit-To-Stand (5xSTS) test time as the primary outcomes. Nonparametric tests and generalized estimating equations were used for analyses. RESULTS: From baseline to follow-up, statistically significant changes in the SPPB total score and 5xSTS test time were observed in all profiles (p<0.05) except the low PC-high PA profile. Over the follow-up period, the decrease was greater for low versus high PA profiles within both PC profiles for SPPB total score (high PC: B -0.61, SE 0.24, 95% CI -1.08, -0.15; low PC: B -0.96, SE 0.35, 95% CI -1.62, -0.32), but not for 5xSTS time. No statistically significant difference was observed in the change in 5xSTS test time between the low and high PA profiles for either PC profile. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that engaging in demanding PA regardless of baseline PC may help to protect against a decline in physical functioning in old age. Consequently, older adults should be encouraged to engage in physically demanding activities that could potentially enhance their functional capacity."

We evaluated the concerns and factors influencing willingness to perform CPR and use AEDs among laypersons in high-risk, low-resource communities. Methods: From April 2022 to March 2024, laypersons in Northern Manhattan's Community District 12 completed surveys assessing their attitudes toward CPR and AED use before attending Hands-Only CPR training. Fisher's Exact Test assessed differences in concerns and willingness to perform CPR and AED use across racial-ethnic groups and compared low-resource communities with high-resource groups consisting of non-clinical staff across eight ambulatory sites. Results: Among 669 respondents, 64% identified as Hispanic, 58% were under 40, and 67% were female. Significant knowledge gaps were identified: 62% had never learned CPR, and 77% were unfamiliar with AEDs. Common concerns included fear of incorrect performance (67%), causing harm (56%), and legal repercussions (53%). Willingness to perform CPR was most influenced by familiarity with the victim (55% family vs. 67% non-family). The main barrier to AED use was a lack of operational knowledge (66%). Non-Hispanic Black participants expressed significantly greater concerns than their non-Hispanic White and Hispanic counterparts. Participants in high-resource settings (n=309) showed higher CPR and AED training rates with similar concerns. Conclusions: Concerns regarding CPR and AED use stem from a lack of confidence and training. Targeted, culturally sensitive community interventions are essential to address these barriers, enhance preparedness, and improve OHCA survival rates."

To estimate the average time to complete patient enrollment and identify factors associated with accrual rates in systemic sclerosis (SSc) randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods. We searched published SSc-RCTs indexed in PubMed from 2000 to 2024, selecting those with recruitment completed before the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded key trial features (country, phase, randomization ratio, intervention, blinding, funding source, outcome type) and enrollment year(s). We measured enrollment duration and accrual rate (participants per month). A multivariable negative binomial generalized linear model was used to identify factors associated with accrual rate. Results. We included 80 studies, mostly single-country (75.0%) and industry-funded (57.5%), with recruitment concentrated in Europe (36.2%) and North America (22.5%). In 65% of studies, both limited and diffuse SSc patients were enrolled. The median sample size was 40.5 patients, with 20% of RCTs enrolling more than 100 patients. The median recruitment time was 15 months (IQR 9.9-30.0), with a median accrual rate of 3.1 (IQR 1.6-5.5) participants per month. Recruitment rates varied over time, with faster accrual early in the 2000s and after 2012, and a slower period in between. Multivariable analysis showed that accrual rate was positively associated with skewed randomization, non-industry funding, international recruitment, and inclusion of both SSc subsets, especially compared to studies involving only dcSSc patients. Conclusions. Recruiting SSc patients for RCTs has been challenging, with generally slow accrual over the past 20 years and no significant improvement over time."

Low areal bone mineral density (aBMD) is a primary indicator of LEA, measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is an advanced imaging device that provides measures of volumetric BMD (vBMD), bone microarchitecture, geometry, and strength. The objective of this study was to assess prevalence of REDs in elite winter sport athletes and to observe the associations in bone parameters using HR-pQCT in athletes identified as at-risk or not at-risk of REDs. Methods: Participants included 101 elite athletes (24.1 +/- 4.4 SD years; 52% female). The REDs Clinical Assessment Tool (CAT2) was used to determine REDs risk. HR-pQCT scans of the non-dominant radius and left tibia were analyzed upon REDs risk grouping. Results: Seventeen athletes (17%; 71% female) were at-risk based on the REDs CAT2. After covarying for lean mass, odds ratios (OR) suggested higher likelihood of REDs risk classification for athletes with low cortical thickness, cortical area, total vBMD, and bone strength. Conclusions: Impaired total vBMD, bone strength and cortical bone parameters were approximately twice as likely (OR: 1.9-3.0) in athletes at-risk of REDs. Results agree with the consensus statement that HR-pQCT may identify impaired bone health in athletes at-risk of REDs. Future directions should use HR-pQCT to explore REDs risk longitudinally, utilizing bone change over time as this may provide greater insight. Using advanced imaging to explore REDs risk in a population of winter high-performance athletes is novel."

Venom induced symptoms ranges from systemic reactions like nausea and vomiting to localised pain and swelling. One major risk is the development of venom induced consumption coagulopathy (VICC), which might result in significant consequences. Plasmapheresis is being investigated as a possible therapy for severe envenoming. Objectives We aim to assess the effectiveness and potential advantages of plasmapheresis in snakebite cases, focusing on clinical results. We seek to find if plasmapheresis improves neurological, renal, and hematological dysfunction and impacts secondary outcomes, including patient discharge rates, morbidity, mortality, duration of hospital stay, and the number of plasmapheresis sessions required. Methods Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search of articles published between 1980 and July 2023 across multiple databases. MeSH terms related to snakebite and plasmapheresis were applied without publication or language type restrictions. Inclusion criteria considered case reports, cross-sectional studies, or case series featuring plasmapheresis in snakebite management. Inclusions were participants aged 18 years or older with confirmed or suspected snakebites, meeting plasmapheresis indications. Exclusions included participants under 18 years, studies reporting only in vitro data, review articles, and redundant reporting. The emphasis was on Emergency Departments or Intensive Care Units. Results In a review of 147 cases (1980 to July 2023), the most common snake was the hump-nosed viper (Hypnale hypnale). Renal, neurological, and hematological dysfunctions improved after plasmapheresis. The mean plasmapheresis sessions were 2.1, and the average hospital stay was 13.13 days. Conclusion Once the data has been analyzed, the result emphasizes the clinical importance of plasmapheresis in snakebite envenoming. It helps decision-making when standard therapies are insufficient or ineffective, potentially saving lives."

Lower HDLC trajectories (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.3, 11.3) and the lowest VIM quintile of nonHDLC (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.3, 3.0) were associated with higher MCI risk. Lower HDLC trajectories (OR = 3.0, 95% CI = 1.6, 5.7) and the lowest VIM quintile of total cholesterol (OR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.5, 3.9) were associated with higher AD risk. The inclusion of lipid-trajectory and VIM groups improved risk-model predictive performance independent of APOE genotype or PRS for AD and lipid levels. These results provide an important real world perspective on the influence of lipid metabolism and blood lipid levels on the development of stable MCI and AD."

While radiation therapy (RT) has been implicated as a risk factor for CHIP, the specific radiation parameters influencing the development of CHIP remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between RT and CHIP and identify relevant radiation parameters affecting CHIP risk. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cancer patients with RT exposure from an institutional biobank. DNA sequencing was performed to detect mutations in 22 CHIP-associated genes. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between clinical characteristics, RT parameters, and CHIP. We identified 736 cancer patients with RT exposure and compared their risk of CHIP to a control cohort of 13,605 individuals. RT was found to be an independent risk factor for developing CHIP (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08-1.77, p=0.009). The prevalence of CHIP in RT patients was 22.8%. Compared to controls, RT patients showed significantly increased mutations in DNMT3A, PPM1D, TP53, and BRCC3. A positive correlation was observed between CHIP risk and biological equivalent dose of radiation. Stereotactic radiation was also associated with increased CHIP prevalence (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.14-4.33, p=0.02). This study demonstrates that RT is associated with an increased risk of CHIP development, particularly mutations in DNA damage response genes. These findings have important implications for cancer care and long-term patient monitoring, emphasizing the need for further research into the mechanisms and consequences of RT-related CHIP."

While clinicopathologic criteria exist for adjuvant treatment, these criteria are imprecise and have not changed for decades. However, no reliable method exists to tailor adjuvant therapy for individual patients based on risk of recurrence after surgery. Using an ultra-sensitive targeted sequencing approach, we demonstrate that circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in lymphatic exudate collected via surgical drains (""lymph"") 24 hours after surgery accurately identifies MRD and outperforms plasma in an initial cohort of 36 HNSCC patients. We then applied the lymph ctDNA test to an independent, multi-site cohort of 37 HNSCC patients, replicating the original finding. Lymph performance was particularly enhanced in locoregional relapse in both cohorts and generalized to early stage (I-II) patients. Analysis of matched plasma collected at this early timepoint was not predictive of recurrence. We demonstrate a liquid biopsy approach using a historically overlooked biofluid to potentially enable precision adjuvant therapy and achieve superior oncologic outcomes. SIGNIFICANCE Postoperative lymphatic exudate represents a novel proximal analyte for MRD detection in HPV- HNSCC designed specifically for use in the immediate post-surgical window when adjuvant therapy decisions must be made. Accurate MRD identification at this early timepoint has potential to augment traditional pathology and personalize adjuvant treatment paradigms in HPV-negative HNSCC."

This study assesses the efficacy of using next-generation portable sequencing (Nanopore Technology) to detect and identify bacterial pathogens directly from tear samples, providing a non-invasive alternative to traditional corneal scraping and culture, which are limited by high false-negative rates. Design: Prospective observational study. Participants: Ten participants diagnosed with corneal ulcers. Methods: Tear samples were collected from the ocular surface using Schirmer strips. Corneal scrapings and cultures were performed as medically indicated. The 16S rRNA gene was amplified directly from the tear samples using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Nanopore sequencing was used for bacterial species identification and taxonomic classification. Comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the concordance between Nanopore sequencing results and traditional culture methods. Main Outcome Measures: Comparison of bacterial species detected via Nanopore sequencing with those identified through traditional culture methods. Results: Bacterial DNA was identified in 8 of the 10 samples analyzed using the tear-based sequencing method. Notably, Nanopore sequencing accurately identified the causative bacteria in all 4 samples that exhibited bacterial growth on culture. Additionally, it detected bacterial pathogens in 2 of the 4 ulcers that did not show bacterial growth on culture. In 2 cases where cultures could not be obtained due to the small size of the ulcer, tear sequencing successfully identified bacterial species, highlighting potentially overlooked pathogens in corneal ulcers. Conclusions: PCR amplification of 16S RNA directly from tears followed by Nanopore sequencing is an effective, non-invasive method to identify bacterial pathogens in corneal ulcers, offering non-inferior results to traditional culture methods. This technique not only allows for the detection of traditionally hard-to-culture organisms, providing immediate diagnostic value to guide treatment, but also enhances our understanding of the microbiological landscape of corneal ulcers, thereby informing more effective treatment strategies."

These patients face significant barriers to accessing care and adhering to self-management strategies due to language barriers, socioeconomic challenges, and cultural differences. Despite the emphasis on self-management for cLBP, limited research has focused on understanding the specific needs and preferences of Spanish- and Cantonese-preferring patients. Objective: This study aimed to explore the self-management priorities of Spanish- and Cantonese-preferring patients with cLBP at an urban, academic-affiliated county hospital. Using a human-centered design approach, we sought to identify patient preferences for self-management support materials and strategies that could be tailored to their unique needs. Methods: We conducted six focus groups (three each for Spanish- and Cantonese-preferring participants) between March and May 2024, involving 27 patients with cLBP. Patients were recruited from an urban safety-net hospital, and focus groups were conducted in participants' preferred language. Participants discussed their experiences with cLBP care, barriers to self-management, and their preferences for educational materials. Data were analyzed using an inductive coding approach to identify key themes. Results: Four primary themes emerged from the focus groups: (1) the need for empathic, tailored educational supports that fit into patients' lives, (2) the desire for self-management plans that account for social and economic constraints, (3) the recognition of mental health and social isolation as critical aspects of cLBP care, and (4) a need for clearer guidance on self-management strategies and trustworthy resources. Both Spanish- and Cantonese-preferring participants expressed a preference for video-based resources, plain-language materials, and support for understanding the causes and management of their pain. Conclusion: Spanish- and Cantonese-preferring patients with cLBP face significant barriers to self-management, but are motivated to engage in self-care if provided with culturally and linguistically appropriate resources. This study highlights the need for healthcare systems to develop and deliver tailored, accessible self-management support materials that address the unique challenges faced by these populations. Human-centered design offers a promising approach to reducing disparities in cLBP outcomes by creating patient-driven solutions that prioritize empathy, practicality, and cultural relevance."

Studies leveraging finite element analysis (FEA) models have shown that variability of gait patterns can lead to significant variability of wear rates in TKR settings. However, FEA models can be resource-intensive and time-consuming to execute, hindering further research in this area. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach aimed at significantly reducing computational costs and processing time compared to traditional FEA models. Methods: A published method was used to generate 314 variations of ISO14243-3(2014) anterior/posterior translation, internal/external rotation, flexion/extension, and axial loading time series, and a validated FEA model was used to calculate linear wear distribution on the polyethylene liner. A deep learning model featuring a transformer-CNN based encoder-decoder architecture was trained to predict linear wear distribution using gait pattern time series as input. Model performance was evaluated by comparing the deep learning and FEA model predictions using metrics such as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for relevant geometric features of the wear scar, structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and normalized mutual information (NMI). Results: The deep learning model significantly reduced the computational time for generating wear predictions compared to FEA, with the former training and inferring in minutes, and the latter requiring days. Comparisons of deep learning model wear map predictions to FEA results yielded MAPE values below 6% for most of the variables and SSIM and NMI values above 0.88, indicating a high level of agreement. Conclusion: The deep learning approach provides a promising alternative to FEA for predicting wear in TKR, with substantial reductions in computational time and comparable accuracy. Future research will aim to apply this methodology to clinical patient data, which could lead to more personalized and timely interventions in TKR settings."

This approach becomes particularly valuable in areas such as motion analysis, where it is challenging to collect substantial amounts of data. The current study introduces a data augmentation strategy that relies on a variational autoencoder to generate synthetic data of kinetic and kinematic variables. The kinematic and kinetic variables consist of hip and knee joint angles and moments, respectively, in both sagittal and frontal plane, and ground reaction forces. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) did not detect significant differences between real and synthetic data for each of the biomechanical variables considered. To further evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a long-short term model (LSTM) was trained both only on real data (R) and on the combination of real and synthetic data (R and S); the performance of each of these two trained models was then assessed on real test data unseen during training. The predictive model achieved comparable results in terms of nRMSE when predicting knee joint moments in the frontal (R and S: 9.86% vs R:10.72%) and sagittal plane (R and S: 9.21% vs R: 9.75%), and hip joint moments in the frontal (R&S: 16.93% vs R:16.79%) and sagittal plane (R&S: 13.29% vs R:14.60%).

In recent years, antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) have shown promise as individualized genetic interventions for rare genetic diseases. However, there is currently no consensus on which disease-causing DNA variants are suitable candidates for this type of genetic therapy. The Patient Identification Working Group of the N=1 Collaborative (N1C), alongside an international group of volunteer assessors, has developed and piloted consensus guidelines for assessing the eligibility of pathogenic variants towards ASO treatments. We herein present the N1C VARIANT (Variant Assessments towards Eligibility for Antisense Oligonucleotide Treatment) guidelines, including the guiding scientific principles and our approach to consensus building. Pathogenic, disease-causing variants can be assessed for the three currently best-established ASO treatment approaches: splice correction, exon skipping, and downregulation of RNA transcripts. A genetic variant is classified as either ""eligible"", ""likely eligible"", ""unlikely eligible"", or ""not eligible"" in relation to the different approaches, or ""unable to assess"". We also review key considerations for assessment for upregulation of transcripts from the wildtype allele, an emerging ASO therapeutic strategy. We provide additional tools and training material to enable clinicians and researchers to use these guidelines for their eligibility assessments. With this initial edition of our N1C VARIANT guidelines, we provide the rare genetic disease community with guidance on how to identify suitable candidates for variant-specific ASO-based therapies and the possibility of integrating such assessments into routine clinical practice."

METHODS: We conducted three experiments among a representative sample of adults living in Canada to elicit value judgements about reducing income-related health inequality vs. improving population health. Each experiment compared two programs: (Experiment 1) universal and tailored vaccination; (Experiment 2) non-specific prevention programs; (Experiment 3) generic health care programs. The programs varied in terms of efficiency (additional life years), and income-related health inequality. Preferences were elicited using benefit-trade off analysis and were classified as: pro-rich (maximizing the health of individuals with the highest income); health maximizer (maximizing total health); weighted prioritarian (willing to trade some health to reduce inequalities); maximin (only improving the health of the individuals with the lowest income); and egalitarian (minimizing health inequalities). RESULTS: We recruited 1,000 participants per experiment. Preferences for the vaccination, prevention, and generic experiments were distributed as follows: pro-rich (Atkinson Index<0): 31%, 22%, and 16% respectively; health maximizers (Atkinson Index=0): 2%, 3%, and 2%, respectively; weighted prioritarians (Atkinson Index>0): 13%, 19%, and 22% respectively; maximins (Atkinson Index={infty}): 0%, 1%, and 3%, respectively; egalitarian (Atkinson Index undefined): 54%, 55%, and 57%, respectively. The median responses reflected a preference for minimizing health inequalities across the three experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a strong aversion to health inequality among people living in Canada with over half of respondents willing to minimize health inequalities regardless of the impact on efficiency."

This paper applies a systematic methodology for evaluating preference alignment in LLMs on categorical decision-making with medical triage as a domain-specific use case. It also measures how effectively an alignment procedure will change the alignment of a specific model. Key to this methodology is a novel simple measure, the Alignment Compliance Index (ACI), that quantifies how effectively a LLM can be aligned to a given preference function or gold standard. Since the ACI measures the effect rather than the process of alignment, it is applicable to alignment methods beyond the in-context learning used in this study. Using a dataset of simulated patient pairs, three frontier LLMs (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini Advanced) were assessed on their ability to make triage decisions consistent with an expert clinicians preferences. The models performance before and after alignment attempts was evaluated using various prompting strategies. The results reveal significant variability in alignment effective- ness across models and alignment approaches. Notably, models that performed well, as measured by ACI, pre-alignment sometimes degraded post-alignment, and small changes in the target preference function led to large shifts in model rankings. The implicit ethical principles, as understood by humans, underlying the LLMs decisions were also explored through targeted questioning.

However, monitoring hand use outside the clinic remains challenging. We developed a clinical decision support system (CDSS) using egocentric video to provide therapists with information about their patients' hand use at home and evaluated its clinical utility. Methods: Five patient-therapist dyads were recruited. Patient-participants recorded activities of daily living using head-mounted cameras. Dashboards presenting processed video data were generated for each patient. Therapists reviewed the dashboard created for their patient and participated in semi-structured interviews and structured questionnaires. A mixed-methods approach with thematic analysis was used to evaluate the CDSS's clinical usefulness. Results: Four themes emerged: (1) Data Interpretation Preferences, (2) Bridging the Clinic-Home Divide, (3) Tailoring Therapy Through Home Observations, and (4) Practical Realities of Implementation. Therapists strongly preferred video footage over graphical data, valuing its rich insights into their patients' real-world activities. The CDSS was perceived as useful for understanding patient performance at home and potentially influencing therapy planning. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of using egocentric video to inform clinical decision-making in neurorehabilitation. Therapists found the system useful, particularly for assessing performance in naturalistic settings, but voiced concerns about workflow integration. Despite challenges, therapists across technical familiarity levels expressed trust in the system and willingness to use it regularly, indicating it could enhance their ability to tailor therapy plans to patients' real-world activities."

This scoping review aims to synthesize the current knowledge base regarding the use of various design approaches for developing quality checklists in healthcare. Secondary objectives are to explore theoretical frameworks, design principles, stakeholder involvement and engagement, and characteristics of the design methods used for developing quality checklists. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 2020 checklist. Seven databases (PubMed, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore) were searched for studies using a comprehensive search strategy developed in collaboration with a health sciences librarian. Search terms  included ""checklist""  and ""user-centered design"" and their related terms. The IAP2 Spectrum of Participation Framework was used to categorize studies by level of stakeholder engagement during data extraction. Twenty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Twenty-three distinct design methods were identified that were predominantly non-collaborative in nature (e.g., interviews, surveys, and other methods that involved only one researcher and one participant at a given time). Analysis of the levels of stakeholder engagement revealed a gap in studies that empowered their stakeholders in the quality checklist design process. Highly effective, clear, and standardized methodology are needed for the design of quality checklists. Future work needs to explore how stakeholders can be empowered in the design process, and how different levels of stakeholder engagement might impact implementation outcomes."

However, few studies have comprehensively examined if South Asian adults in the United States (US) develop cardiovascular risk factors at younger ages than adults from other race and ethnic groups. Objective: To compare the prevalence and change in ASCVD risk factors across age strata by race and ethnic group. Design: We combined data from the Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort studies. Longitudinal data from all eligible participants at all available exam visits were used to estimate the prevalence of risk factors at ages 45 and 55 years for each race and ethnic group. Setting: Multicenter longitudinal cohort study in 7 field centers across the U.S. Participants: The baseline study sample included individuals free of clinical ASCVD; 554 South Asians, 796 White, 588 Black, 517 Hispanic/Latino, and 245 Chinese adults aged 45-55 years were included. Exposures: Self-identified race (Black, Chinese, South Asian, or White) or ethnic group (Hispanic/Latino). Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Prevalence of clinical (prediabetes & diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, BMI) and behavioral (diet quality, alcohol use, exercise) ASCVD risk factors at age 45 and age 55. Results: At age 45, South Asian men and women had the highest prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes and higher prevalence of hypertension compared to White, Chinese, and Hispanic/Latino men and women. South Asian men had a higher prevalence of dyslipidemia than White, Chinese, and Black men, and South Asian women had a higher prevalence than Chinese and Black women. All groups had worse diet quality than South Asian men and women at age 45, and most also had higher rates of alcohol use. Conclusions and Relevance: We observed significant differences in the prevalence of risk factors for South Asian adults compared to adults from other U.S. race and ethnic groups at age 45 years. Understanding trends and disparities in cardiovascular risk and protective factors across the life course can help equitably improve prevention and treatment strategies for US populations."

Prior research indicates that males with PTSD exhibit hypoconnectivity of frontal brain regions measured with resting electroencephalography (EEG). The present study examined functional connectivity among females with PTSD and trauma-exposed controls, as well as the impact of sex hormones. Methods: Participants included 61 females (Mage = 31.41, SD = 8.64) who endorsed Criterion A trauma exposure. Resting state EEG data were recorded for five minutes in the eyes open position. Using a Linear Mixed Effects model, paired region-of-interest power envelope connectivity of the theta band (4-7 Hz) served as the response variables. Results: Compared to controls, the PTSD group displayed hyperconnectivity between visual brain regions and the rest of the cerebral cortex (pFDR < 0.05). Additionally, participants with PTSD demonstrated enhanced connectivity between the default mode network and frontoparietal control network compared to controls (pFDR < 0.05), as well as increased connectivity between the ventral attention network and the rest of the cerebral cortex (pFDR < 0.05). Estradiol was associated with higher connectivity, while progesterone was associated with lower connectivity, but these did not survive correction. Conclusions: Results are consistent with prior research indicating that PTSD is associated with altered connectivity in visual brain regions, which may reflect disrupted visual processing related to reexperiencing symptoms (e.g., intrusive memories). Our findings provide additional support for the relevance of the theta frequency range in PTSD given its role in fear learning and regulation processes."

India accounted for 55% of the global population at risk of LF in 2021. The World Health Organization (WHO) has targeted LF elimination by 2030; however, India aims to achieve LF elimination prior to the global WHO NTD target. Mathematical models are useful tools to evaluate and guide elimination strategies. We propose a new compartmental model - COmpartmental Modelling of Elimination strategies and Transmission of Lymphatic Filariasis (COMET-LF) - to assess the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) on LF elimination. Our model incorporates drug efficacy data from a clinical trial and generates estimates of disease (lymphoedema and hydrocele) prevalence. The model is calibrated to publicly available microfilaria (Mf) and disease prevalence data (2008-2013) from Bihar, India. Predictions of the number of MDA rounds needed for achieving the elimination threshold were generated for various endemic scenarios. The projected estimates were compared with established micro - (LYMFASIM) and macro - (EPIFIL) simulation models for LF transmission. Disease burden estimates and the impact of MDA on disease burden were generated using COMET-LF for different endemic scenarios. Our simulations suggest that the disease burden reduces over much longer timescales - ~20 years for a reduction of 8%-11.5% following 5 rounds of MDA. We extended COMET-LF to a meta-population model to investigate the role of migration among neighbouring regions on elimination and resurgence probabilities. We found that high Mf prevalence in the spatial neighbourhood can increase the number of required MDA rounds for elimination up to 3 additional rounds for the two-drug regimen. Furthermore, we assess the impact of migration on the resurgence probability in a non-endemic region which is spatially adjacent to a high-Mf prevalence region and show that there is a  significant risk of resurgence if Mf prevalence exceeds 5%. Our model can be easily tailored to specific blocks and districts to guide programmatic intervention for disease management and LF elimination."

Over the years its prevalence has increased and affects 1% children globally. Etiology of ASD is remained unclear, but it is well recognized as a complex disorder involving interactions of several genes and environmental risk factors. Studies signify the role of whole exome sequencing in identifying rare genetic variation related to neurodevelopmental disorders and have greatly improved the chance of identifying known as well as novel responsible genes. This study aimed to identify genetic variant in a patient affected with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: A male patient of age range 0-5 years was investigated and identified according to DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Peripheral blood sample was collected followed by genomic DNA extraction and whole exome sequencing. The functional impact of variant, gene interaction network and pathway enrichment analysis were done using in silico tools and databases. Results: Two heterozygous missense variants one in SHANK2 (c.401C>G) another in CSNK2A1 (c.572G>A) were identified. Both of these variants were predicted to be deleterious by pathogenicity prediction tool. Gene interaction network and pathway enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of SHANK2 and CSNK2A1 in various biological pathways such as protein binging, synaptogenesis, chromosome condensation and cell cycle regulation. Conclusion: This study revealed a novel SHANK2 variant along with a known CSNK2A1 variant that expands the spectrum of genetic variants related to autism spectrum disorder and further enhances the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying SHANK2 and CSNK2A1 pathophysiology."

Given the emerging bidirectional communication between the brain-body axis in both WMHs and AD, it is important to understand their genetic underpinnings across the whole body. However, literature on this is scarce. We investigated the brain-body axis by breaking down heritability estimates of these phenotypes across the whole body, i.e., partitioning heritability. Our aims were to identify genetic underpinnings specific to WMHs, and common between WMHs and AD, by assessing (a) the partitioned heritability of WMHs and AD across the brain-body axis with tissue-specific annotations, (b) the partitioned heritability of WMHs and AD across the brain-body axis with cell-specific annotations, and (c) the genes associated with WMHs and AD, and verifying their expression levels across the whole body. Our tissue-specific analysis revealed that WMH-associated SNPs were significantly enriched in tissues beyond the brain, namely liver, cardiovascular, and kidney with liver being a common tissue enriched for both WMHs and AD. Our cell-specific analysis showed enrichment of vascular endothelial cells across the tissue types enriched for WMHs, highlighting their central role in the development of WMHs. Additionally, our gene-level analysis highlighted overlapping patterns of tissue enrichment for both WMHs and AD, and showed interactions between WMH and AD associated genes. Our findings provide new insights into the systemic influences potentially contributing to WMH pathology, in particular, multi-system endothelial disorder. We hope that our multisystemic genetic findings will stimulate future WMH-research into specific pathways across the brain-body axis."

Variants in SLC6A1 result in a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a variable clinical presentation of symptoms including developmental delay, epilepsy, motor dysfunction, and autism spectrum disorder. SLC6A1 encodes the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter (GAT-1) protein that is responsible for the reuptake of GABA from the synapse to maintain homeostasis of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. SLC6A1 haploinsufficiency has been confirmed as the predominant pathway of SLC6A1-related neurodevelopmental disorders, however, the molecular mechanism underlying the variable presentation of clinical features remains unclear. Here, through work of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network, we identify an undiagnosed individual with an inherited p.(A334S) variant of uncertain significance. Pedigree analysis identifies variable symptoms between family members with the same variant. To resolve this case, we first compare proband phenotypes to a cohort of cases diagnosed with SLC6A1-related neurodevelopmental disorders and find significant symptom overlap. We then functionally compare this variant to other variants by creating an allelic series in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. We identify phenotypes in flies expressing SLC6A1 variants consistent with a loss-of-function mechanism and conclude that the p.(A334S) variant is a hypomorphic allele. Through clinical and functional genomics, we begin to elucidate the underlying variability in SLC6A1-neurodevelopmental disorders. These insights will inform clinical diagnosis, prognosis, treatment planning, and aid in the design of targeted therapeutics for those living with SLC6A1-related neurodevelopmental disorders."

This study aimed to determine the association between METS-IR and acute ischemic stroke in non-diabetic patients, and the mediating role of blood pressure parameters on it. Methods: This hospital-based study included 557 non-diabetic subjects diagnosed with premature acute ischemic stroke. Logistic regression models and mediation analyses were conducted to assess the role of blood pressure parameters (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and mean arterial pressure) in the associations between METS-IR and risk of acute ischemic stroke. Results: After adjusting for potential covariates, each SD increment of METS-IR was associated with 26% higher odds (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.06-1.52) increment in ORs of acute ischemic stroke. The OR for acute ischemic stroke in patients with highest quartile of METS-IR was 1.73 hold (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.12-2.70) higher than that in those with the lowest quartile of METS-IR. Furthermore, mediation analyses indicated that pulse pressure partially mediate the detrimental effect of insulin resistance (assessed by the METS-IR) on acute ischemic stroke (mediation percentage: 11.70%).

However, patient utilization of MHC services varies substantially. Strategies to increase utilization are therefore needed to maximize the effectiveness of MHC services by serving more patients in need. The purpose of this study is to develop a statistical framework to identify and prioritize high-risk communities for delivery of MHCs during health emergencies. Methods: Prisma Health MHCs delivered COVID-19 vaccines to communities throughout South Carolina between February 20, 2021, and February 17, 2022. In this retrospective study, we use generalized linear mixed effects model and ordinal logistic regression model to identify factors associated with, and predict, MHC utilization for COVID-19 vaccination by census tract. Results: The MHCs conducted 260 visits to 149 sites and 107 census tracts. The site-level analysis showed that visits to schools (RR=2.17, 95% CI=1.47-3.21), weekend visits (RR=1.38, 95% CI=1.03-1.83), and visits when the resources were limited (term 1: 7.11, 95% CI=4.43-11.43) and (term 2: 2.40, 95% CI=1.76-3.26) were associated with greater MHC utilization for COVID-19 vaccination. MHC placement near existing vaccination centers (RR=0.79, 95% CI=0.68-0.93) and hospitals (RR=0.83, 95% CI=0.71-0.96) decreased utilization. Predictive models identified 1,227 (94.7%) census tracts with more than 250 individuals per MHC visit when vaccine resources were limited. Predictions showed satisfactory accuracy (72.6%). The census tracts with potential of high MHC demand had higher adolescent, 30-44 years old, non-White populations, lower Primary Care Practitioners per 1,000 residents, fewer hospitals, and higher cumulative COVID-19 emergency department visits and deaths (compared to census tracts in the low MHC demand category). After the vaccines became widely available, the demand at MHCs declined. Conclusion: These study findings can be used to improve MHC allocation by identifying and prioritizing medically underserved communities for strategic delivery of these limited resources."

Diabetes complications are associated with increased healthcare costs and worsened patient outcomes. In this paper we analyze how individual-level demographic and territorial-level socioeconomic and healthcare variables influence the presence and severity of diabetes complications and their relationship with mortality. Methods. Our study utilizes anonymized administrative data from Hungary, containing outpatient and inpatient records of all diabetes patients between 2010 to 2017. We construct settlement-year level and individual-year level panel datasets to analyze diabetes prevalence, incidence and complications, employing Poisson and logit models to explore associations between complications and the explanatory variables. The adapted Diabetes Complications Severity Index (aDCSI) is employed to quantitatively evaluate the severity of complications by aggregating individual complication scores from ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Results. Diabetes prevalence and incidence are higher in settlements with above-median unemployment rates, where patients exhibit more severe complications, as shown by higher average aDCSI scores. Among socioeconomic factors, unemployment rate is particularly associated with increased aDCSI scores, while better healthcare access is associated with lower aDCSI scores in unadjusted but with higher scores in adjusted models. The presence and severity of complications, especially renal, cardio-vascular and peripheral vascular ones, substantially increase five-year inpatient mortality. Most of the mortality difference by settlement-level unemployment rate disappears when complications are accounted for. Conclusions. Territorial-level socioeconomic disparities, especially elevated unemployment rates, significantly exacerbate the severity of diabetes complications, which subsequently heightens the mortality risk among diabetic patients. Enhancing health-care access in lower socioeconomic regions may alleviate these disparities and lessen the impact of complications."

Remote cognitive testing provides a means of assessing early changes. We explored the relationship between neurodegenerative biomarkers and cognition in cognitively normal individuals. METHODS: We remotely deployed 13 computerised Cognitron tasks in 255 members of the Insight 46 study. We generated whole brain, hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity volumes at ages 69-73, rates of change over two-years, amyloid load and positivity. We examined the relationship between Cognitron, biomarkers, and standard neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Slower response time on a delayed recognition task predicted amyloid positivity (OR=1.79,CI:1.15, 2.95). Brain and hippocampal atrophy rates correlated with poorer visuospatial performance (b=-0.42, CI:-0.80, -0.05) and accuracy on immediate recognition (b=-0.01, CI:-0.01, -0.001), respectively. Standard tests correlated with Cognitron composites (rho=0.43, p<0.001). DISCUSSION: Remote computerised testing correlates with standard supervised assessments and holds potential for studying early cognitive changes associated with neurodegeneration."

With growing utilization of endovascular therapy for cerebrovascular disease, we examined trends in endovascular versus neurosurgical treatment of infectious aneurysms and investigated the impact of treatment modality on outcomes. Methods: Using data from the National Inpatient Sample from 2000 to 2019, we conducted a trends analysis on rates of treatment modalities among hospitalizations with infective endocarditis with ruptured or unruptured cerebral aneurysms. Treatment modalities were categorized as endovascular versus open neurosurgical repair based on ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Logistic regressions were utilized to assess the association between treatment modality and the outcomes of in-hospital mortality and discharge disposition. Results: We identified 24,461 hospitalizations with an infectious intracranial aneurysm in the setting of infective endocarditis. Mean age was 56.0 years (SD, 17.8) and 61.8% were male. The overall rate of intervention was 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0-6.5%), and this did not change over time (p=0.669). There was a significant increase in the rate of endovascular repair (APC=3.6%; 95% CI, 1.2%-8.1%) and a significant decrease in the rate of open neurosurgical repair (APC= -5.4%; 95% CI, -8.1% to -3.5%). Treatment modality was not associated with in-hospital mortality (p=0.698) or non-home discharge disposition (p=0.897). Conclusion: Although rates of infectious intracranial aneurysm intervention for infective endocarditis did not change, utilization of endovascular treatment increased while the use of open neurosurgical treatment decreased. Further directions include elucidating predictors of favorable outcomes for undergoing intervention and the most beneficial timing for the procedure during hospitalization."

COVID-19 has spread to hundreds of millions of individuals since Dec 2019. This study aimed to investigate the common pathogenic mechanisms of differentiated thyroid cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection in thyroid tissues. Methods: The proteomic profiles of COVID-19 and differentiated thyroid cancer were downloaded from iProx database and were analyzed for differentially expressed proteins. After the common proteins were identified using the Venn diagram, gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis were performed. Subsequently, a protein-protein interaction network was constructed and hub genes were identified with eight algorithms. The diagnostic performance of hub genes was tested with the receiver operator characteristics curve. The associations between hub genes and diseases were evaluated with the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. Results: Forty-nine common differentially expressed proteins were identified. Functional analysis revealed that the metabolism and transport of lipid and cholesterol and coagulation process were the main common biological activities affected by the two diseases. In addition, twelve genes, including AGT, AHSG, APOA2, APOM, C3, GC, ITIH2, KNG1, SERPINA1, SERPINC1, TF and TTR, were identified as the hub genes. These genes could serve as diagnostic markers for COVID-19 and differentiated thyroid cancers. Conclusion: The current study revealed common pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 and differentiated thyroid cancer.

This study assessed the effect of implementing a trauma quality improvement programme using audit filters on health-related quality of life in adult trauma patients in urban India. We conducted a controlled interrupted time series study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT03235388) across four tertiary care university hospitals. Adult ([&ge;]18 years) trauma patients, who were alive at 90 days post-admission, were included. After a 14-month observation phase, two hospitals were randomized to the intervention arm and implemented the trauma quality improvement programme, while two control hospitals did not implement any interventions. The study spanned from 2017 to 2022. Health-related quality of life was assessed 90 days post-admission using the EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. The main outcome was EQ-5D health status, scaled from 0 to 100, analyzed using a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. Descriptive analysis was performed for the five individual EQ-5D dimensions. 2307 participants were eligible for the analyses. The DiD analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the EQ-5D health status score in the intervention arm (DiD estimate -4.07 [95% CI: -7.00; -1.15]). For the 819 patients with major trauma, there was a more pronounced, but statistically insignificant reduction (DiD estimate -4.86 [95% CI: -9.87; 0.15]). In the intervention arm, mobility, self-care, and pain/discomfort improved, while usual activities and anxiety/depression worsened. Implementing trauma quality improvement programmes using audit filters may reduce the average health-related quality of life of trauma patients if more severely injured patients survive, highlighting the importance of assessing quality of life after the implementation of such programmes and ensuring adequate rehabilitation resources to support long-term recovery."

The World Health Organization (WHO) indicates that the diabetes epidemic will continue in the coming decades, yielding enormous human and economic costs around the world. This study aims at accessing the health-related Quality of Life (QoL) of Type 2 Diabetic Patients in Ghana. Method: This was a hospital-based cross-sectional descriptive study conducted in the 3 regions in Ghana among 1194 patients with type 2 diabetes who were seeking healthcare at the regional hospitals of the selected regions for at least 12 months. A multi-stage sampling technique was used in recruiting the participants. The WHOQOL-BREF tool was adopted to assess the health-related QoL of diabetic patients. Data was analyzed using STATA version 16.1, and the findings were presented in the tables. Statistical significance was set at (P < 0.05). Results: Out of the 1194 participants, 90% (1079) reported a satisfactory quality of life. The majority (60.3%) of participants were above 50 years of age. The overall mean score of the QoL was 6.25 (1.28) for all four domains: psychological, physical, social, relationship, and environmental health. Marital status, occupational status, and self-reported health status predicted overall QOL. Males have a better quality of life than females, and those below 50 also have a better quality of life than those above 50. Similarly, those employed had a better quality of life than the unemployed; however, those who were married, unmarried, educated, and non-educated had no significant differences in their quality of life. Sex was associated with all the domains. Marital status was associated with the environmental, social, and psychological domains. Age was associated with psychological and physical domains. On predictors of quality of life, all demographic variables (age, sex, educational status, marital status, and employment status) predicted quality of life across all domains. Conclusion: This study provided valuable insights on predictors of health-related QoL among type 2 diabetic patients in Ghana, which would guide policymakers, healthcare providers, and stakeholders in improving diabetes management and ultimately enhancing the quality of life for individuals living with diabetes in Ghana. Evidence-based interventions should be implemented to address the factors influencing the QoL of diabetic patients in Ghana. Keywords: Health-Related, Quality of Life (QoL), Type 2 Diabetic, Ghana"

Efforts to improve the sustainability of food initiatives within healthcare institutions could mitigate these threats by addressing the four pillars of sustainability: health, social, economic, and environmental. Understanding current initiatives to incorporate sustainability into food programs and the sustainability pillars that guide those initiatives is important to inform priorities for action. This scoping review was undertaken to investigate the extent to which major healthcare institutions in Ontario, Canada, have publicly committed to, discussed, planned, and/or implemented sustainable food initiatives. Methods and Analysis Steps are based on guidance from the Joanna Briggs Institute and Arksey & O'Malley. First, the current strategic plans of 57 healthcare institutions in Ontario, Canada, will be retrieved from their websites and used to examine whether they include any commitments to or discussion, planning, and/or implementation of relevant initiatives. The healthcare institution websites, along with those of selected sustainability organizations, will be searched for grey literature from 2015 to 2024 describing sustainable food initiatives within these institutions. Documents will be screened for eligibility by two researchers. Data related to the incorporation of sustainable food into institutional food programs, and the sustainability pillars addressed, will be extracted by one researcher, with 10% of entries verified by a second researcher. The data will be synthesized to summarize publicly reported progress toward integrating sustainable food into healthcare institutions. Ethics and Dissemination This review will use publicly available grey literature with no expectation of privacy and no research participants; therefore, no ethics clearance is required. Results will be shared with stakeholders in sustainability organizations, as well as at relevant conferences and in peer-reviewed journals, such as the Healthy Cities Conference and the Journal of Canadian Food Studies.

Nevertheless, opportunistic screening of never smokers has become commonplace in certain regions of East Asia. Lung cancer detection rates reported for this low-risk group regularly exceed those reported in the randomized trials. We sought to determine the lead time, the length of time between screen detection and when symptoms would manifest (clinical presentation) associated with LDCT detection rates reported in Taiwan. Objective To estimate the lead time for LDCT lung cancer detection in never smoking Taiwanese females, under the assumption that all detected cancers progress. Methods We analyzed data from the Taiwan Lung Cancer Screening in Never-Smoker Trial (TALENT), a prospective cohort of 12000~ never smokers aged 55 to 75, and compared age-specific screen detection rates to lung cancer incidence rates in the pre-screening period. Lead time was estimated using Morrison's approximation: one-half the ratio of screen detection to pre-screening incidence. Results: Invasive lung cancer detection rates in non-smoking females were 18 (age 70-74) to 37 (age 55-59) times higher than the respective age-specific lung cancer incidence rates prior to widespread screening. The estimated lead times for invasive lung cancers thus ranged from 9 (age 70 to 74) to 18.5 years (age 55 to 59). Had we included in situ lung cancer detection, the estimated lead time of screening would range from approximately 10 to 20 years. Conclusion If all detected cancers progress, the lead times for LDCT lung cancer detection in never smokers would be 5 to 20 times longer than that reported in the randomized trials of heavy smokers (1 to 2 years). Such extended lead times are not only undesirable (Why label and treat a patient for a cancer not destined to clinically present in the next 1 or 2 decades?), but also a major source of overdiagnosis, providing plenty of time for a patient to die from other causes before developing a symptomatic cancer (Type 1 overdiagnosis). Furthermore, some screen-detected cancers may not progress and thus have an infinite lead time (Type 2 overdiagnosis). Regardless, it appears that substantial overdiagnosis has occurred in screening low-risk, never smoking individuals."

This measure has been collected in England since 2015 as a part of mandated 2-2[1/2]-year health visiting reviews and collated nationally in the Community Services Dataset (CSDS). CSDS is known to be incomplete and to-date there have not been any published analyses of ASQ(R)-3 held within CSDS. Objectives We aimed to a) identify a subset of complete child development data for children aged two in England using ASQ(R)-3 data in CSDS between 2018/19-2020/21; b) use this subset of data to analyse child development age 2-2[1/2] years in England. Methods We compared counts of ASQ(R)-3 records in CSDS by local authority and financial quarter against national, publicly available health visiting metrics to identify local authorities with complete ASQ(R)-3 records in CSDS. We described child development in this subset of the data using both a binary cut-off of whether a child reached expected level of development and the continuous ASQ(R)-3 score. Results Among the 226,505 children from 64 local authorities in our sample with complete ASQ(R)-3 records, 86.2% met expected level of development. Children from the most deprived neighbourhoods (82.6%), children recorded as Black (78.9%), and boys (81.7%) were less likely to meet expected level of development. Conclusions To fully understand child development in England, the completeness of ASQ(R)-3 data in the CSDS requires improvement. Second, to interpret the national CSDS data on child development, ASQ(R)-3 should be standardised and validated in an English context.

Early measures of hypersensitive narcissism used Murray's Narcissism Scale, which was explored by measuring the narcissism levels of Harvard undergraduates. Hendin and Cheek subsequently developed the Hypersensitive Sensitive Narcissism Scale based on this narcissism scale. In addition to this, there are few ways to measure vulnerability-sensitive narcissism, and Chinese measurement tools on narcissism mainly measure explicit narcissism, neglecting to accurately measure vulnerability-sensitive narcissism, and failing to completely respond to an individual's implicit narcissistic traits. Aim: The hypersensitive narcissism scale was applied to college students to explore the factor structure of the scale under the background of Chinese culture, and to test its reliability and validity. Methods 1000 questionnaires were distributed to college students, and 912 valid questionnaires were collected. Self-Esteem Scale, Aggression Scale and Narcissism subscale of Dark Triad Scale were used as the criterion. After 3 weeks, 100 college students were randomly selected for retest. Results: The exploratory factor analysis showed that one dimension should be extracted. Eigenvalue was 5.352 and 53.518% cumulative variance interpretation rate. The confirmatory factor analysis showed that the scale structure validity was good. Internal consistency reliability of the scale was 0.785; The test-retest reliability was 0.833, and the criterion correlation validity reached a significant level. Conclusion: The Chinese version of hypersensitive narcissism scale has good reliability and validity, which can effectively measure hypersensitive narcissism. The localisation of the scale can better serve the research and development of the university student population on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can help the research in this field to have a more in-depth development in China."

Early diagnosis of PD is crucial for effective treatment, yet traditional diagnostic models are often costly and lengthy. This study explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, particularly voice analysis, to identify early signs of PD and make a precise diagnosis. Objectives: This paper aims to create an automatic detection and prediction of PD binary classification using vocal biomarkers. We will also use explainability to identify latent and important patterns in the input data in retrospect to the target to inform the definition of Parkinson's through voice characteristics. Finally, a probability generation will be generated to create a scoring system of a patient's odds of PD as a spectrum. Methods: We utilized a dataset comprising 81 voice recordings from both healthy control (HC) and PD patients, applying a hybrid AI model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The model's architecture was designed to extract and analyze acoustic features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), local jitter, and local shimmer, which are all indicative of PD-related voice impairments. Once features are extracted, the AI model will generate prediction labels for HC or PD files. Then, a scoring system will assign a number ranging from 0-1 to each file, indicating the stage of PD development. Results: Our champion model yielded the following results: diagnostic accuracy of 91.11%, recall of 92.50%, precision of 89.84%, an F1 score of 0.9113, and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.9125. Furthermore, the use of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) provided detailed insight into the model's decision-making process, highlighting the most influential features contributing to a PD diagnosis. The outcomes of the implemented scoring system demonstrate a distinct separation in the probability assessments for PD across the 81 analyzed audio samples, validating our scoring system by confirming that the vocal biomarkers in the audio files accurately correspond with their assigned scores. Conclusion: This study highlights the efficacy of AI, particularly a hybrid model combining CNN, RNN, MKL, and Deep Learning in diagnosing early PD through voice analysis. The model demonstrated a robust ability to distinguish between HC and PD patients with significant accuracy by leveraging key vocal biomarkers such as MFCCs, jitter, and shimmer."

The literature establishes a strong link between WMH burden and cognitive decline, and suggests that the anatomical distribution of WMH mediates cognitive dysfunction. Pathological remodeling of major cerebral arteries (anterior, ACA; middle, MCA; posterior, PCA) may increase WMH burden in an arterial territory (AT)-specific manner. However, this has not been systematically studied across neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). To address this gap, we aimed to assess WMH distribution (i) across ATs per clinical category, (ii) across clinical categories per AT, and (iii) between men and women. We also investigated the association between AT-specific WMH burden and cognition. Using two cohorts - Canadian CCNA-COMPASS-ND (N=927) and US-based NIFD (N=194) - we examined WMH distribution across ten clinical categories: cognitively unimpaired (CU), subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer disease (AD), MCI and AD with high vascular injury (+V), Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson's disease (PD), and PD with cognitive impairment or dementia. WMH masks were segmented from FLAIR MRI and mapped onto an arterial atlas. Cognitive performance was assessed using four psychometric tests evaluating reaction time and overall cognition, namely Simple Reaction Time (SRT), Choice Reaction Time (CRT), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Statistical analyses involved linear regression models, controlling for demographic factors, with a 5% False Discovery Rate for multiple comparisons. Our transdiagnostic analysis revealed unique AT-specific WMH burden patterns. Comparisons between ACA and PCA territories revealed distinct burden patterns in clinical categories with similar whole-brain WMH burden, while the MCA territory consistently exhibited the highest burden across all categories, despite accounting for AT size. Hemispheric asymmetries were noted in seven diagnostic categories, with most showing higher WMH burden in the left MCA territory. Our results further revealed distinct AT-specific WMH patterns in diagnostic groups that are more vascular than neurodegenerative (i.e., MCI+V, AD+V). Categories often misdiagnosed in clinical practice, such as FTD and AD, displayed contrasting WMH signatures across ATs. SCD showed distinct AT-specific WMH patterns compared to CU and NDD participants. Additionally, sex-specific differences emerged in five NDDs, with varying AT effects. Importantly, AT-specific WMH burden was associated with slower processing speed in MCI (PCA) and AD (ACA, MCA). This study highlights the importance of evaluating WMH distribution through a vascular-based brain parcellation. We identified ATs with increased vulnerability to WMH accumulation across NDDs, revealing distinct WMH signatures for multiple clinical categories. In the AD continuum, these signatures correlated with cognitive impairment, underscoring the potential for vascular considerations in imaging criteria to improve diagnostic precision."

Distress and depression have been found to predict the development of chronic pain conditions. Evidence suggests pain-related distress is qualitatively different from depressive illness, and current referral pathways and available interventions are sub-optimal for people with persistent MSK pain and distress. We aimed to develop and test the acceptability and proof of concept of an intervention to reduce pain-related distress in people with chronic MSK pain. Methods: The Person-Based Approach (PBA)(1) informed the processes undertaken to inform intervention development. This included semi-structured interviews with people with persistent pain and with General Practitioners (GPs); and a stakeholder discussion with social prescribers. Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) representatives had input throughout all development work. Findings from these activities were triangulated to inform the development of a prototype intervention which was tested in a repeated-measures, mixed methods proof-of-concept study called De-Stress Pain. The De-Stress Pain intervention offered 4-6 social prescriber sessions over 12 weeks, and access to a study website. 16 participants were recruited from general practices, and 4 social prescribers were recruited from Primary Care Networks (PCNs) and charitable organisations. Both quantitative measures and qualitative interviews were completed by participants at baseline and 12 weeks post-baseline. Quantitative measures included questions about mood (DAPOS, WEMWBS, 4DSQ), pain chronicity, pain intensity and musculoskeletal health (MSK-HQ). Semi-structured interviews with participants explored the participants context, their experiences of pain related distress, and their experiences of the intervention. Social prescribers were interviewed to explore their experiences of delivering the intervention. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The De-Stress Pain intervention was acceptable both to patients and to social prescribers. Some participants experienced positive changes such as improved mood, increased hope and increased activity. The social prescribers (""De-Stress Coaches"") provided accountability and supported motivation. All measures of mood showed improvement. Limited time and money were identified as barriers to engagement, along with participants holding the view that increasing pleasurable activities was indulgent. Some participants were already socially engaged and busy at the point of entering the study. Conclusions: We have confirmed the intervention is needed, acceptable and welcomed by people with pain. Social prescribers found the intervention acceptable to deliver. We identified the barriers that need to be addressed in future versions of the intervention."

Methods: We assessed the relationship between the cadence of RWE publications and sales of sacubitril/valsartan (Entresto) following launch. Publication data were derived from a PubMed search over 7/01/2015-12/31/2023 for English-language, human subject studies with the drug name (Entresto or sacubitril) and indication (heart failure) in the title or abstract. Quarterly RWE publication data were combined with quarterly information on sacubitril/valsartan sales over the 34-quarter period spanning Q3 2015 through Q4 2023. Quarter-to-quarter change in total sales was modeled with linear regression as a function of counts of previously published RWE-related studies, adjusting for a linear time trend to control for any underlying trends in sales growth; change in total sales from the quarter prior to publication to the quarter of publication to control for recent sales changes; and the cumulative count of RWE publications from Q3 2015 through the previous quarter to control for the contribution of previous RWE publications to future sales. Results: The PubMed search identified 888 studies; of these, 333 (37.5%) were classified as RWE-related. An additional RWE-related publication (in quarter q) was associated with an estimated mean increase in quarterly sales of $1.8M (from quarter q to q+1 following publication), $3.5M (from q+1 to q+2), and $2.7M (from q+2 to q+3). In adjusted models, an additional RWE publication was associated with a mean gain in sales from quarter q+1 to q+2 of $2.6M (95% CI $0.2M to $5.4M). RWE publications were not associated with an increase in sales in the quarter following publication, and the association was attenuated by third quarter following publication. Conclusion: RWE studies were associated with increased use of sacubitril/valsaratan, providing preliminary evidence of RWE's ability to support therapy adoption."

Though important in mitigating adverse health outcomes, SDOH impacting metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) prevalence and severity are understudied and results are conflicting. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the impact of specific SDOH factors on MASLD disease burden for adults in the United States (US). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane databases per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Studies from January 2010- May 2024 were included. Quantitative studies of adults in the US that evaluated SDOH beyond race/ethnicity were included. Outcomes included prevalence of MASLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), MASH-associated advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and clinical outcomes. Results: We identified 18 studies comprising of 547,634 total subjects from 11 unique cohorts. Nine studies evaluated MASLD prevalence, three MASH prevalence, eight MASH-associated advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis prevalence, and nine clinical outcomes. High diet quality was the most consistent SDOH factor associated with both MASLD and MASH-associated advanced fibrosis/cirrhosis prevalence (summarized OR of 0.76 p <0.01, and 0.74 p <0.01, respectively). Lower income was most consistently associated with risk of clinical outcomes (significant in 3/9 studies). Conclusions: Diet quality was the most consistent SDOH associated with disease prevalence and severity in MASLD, with the remainder of SDOH showing inconsistent associations. Prospective assessments using consistent, validated tools to assess the impact of specific SDOH on MASLD disease burden are needed to inform public health interventions to mitigate health disparities in MASLD."

Based on its protein expression using immunohistochemical methods it does not express the hormone receptors (oestrogen and progesterone) and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). As a result the only means of treating TNBC patients so far is by conventional chemotherapy +/- radiotherapy. Even then only 50.0 % of these patients will respond to the chemotherapy. Further studies which may help improve treatment and survival in these patients are important. Objective: This study is aimed at knowing the histopathological profile of TNBCs in Abuja with the expression of androgen receptor; an important marker in these patients. Method: Two hundred formalin-fixed paraffin embedded TNBC tissue blocks were selected for the study. The histological type and their respective histological grades (based on the Nottingham grading system) were noted from the haematoxylin and eosin(H&E) sections. Immunohistochemical staining was done using antibodies against androgen receptor (Biocare) and CK5/6 (Invitrogen) with in-house controls. The androgen receptor and CK5/6 expressions were analysed using a semi-quantitative scoring method: -A tumour was considered positive for LAR if [&ge;] 1.0 % of tumour cell nuclei were staining and positive for CK5/6 if [&ge;]10.0 % of tumour cells had membrane staining. Other biographic data like tumour size, presence or absence of lymphovascular permeation were also analysed. Correlation between the histological types and grades were also done using SPSS version 21 statistical package. Results: The 30-49 age group had the highest frequency of TNBC. The commonest histological type seen among TNBCs is Invasive carcinoma; NST at 93.0%. The most frequent histological grade is grade 2 at 56.0 %. The androgen receptor subtype constituted 19.0 %. The basal subtype formed 28.5 % of the total sample size. There was no significant correlation between the histological type and grade of TNBC. 73.3% of the patients had tumour size of pT1 and pT2. Conclusion: This study shows that the percentage of androgen positive cases among triple negative breast carcinomas is significant enough to warrant routine luminal AR testing for TNBCs. Furthermore, this study has shown that the most frequent histological type is Invasive carcinoma; Non-specific type (NST) regardless of the molecular subtype and presence or absence of lympho-vascular permeation. It has also shown that the most frequent histological grade seen among patients with TNBCs is Grade 2."

However, the kidney-heart relationship in this population remains poorly understood, particularly in the context of dialysis modality and duration. This study aims to investigate the associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular (LV) mass, and dialysis modality and duration in pediatric CKD patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 16 pediatric CKD patients (median age 3.6 years; 31.3% female and 68.75% male), stratified by the presence of cardiac dysfunction (LVEF [&le;] 50%). Clinical data, including eGFR, LVEF, LV mass, and dialysis history (hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis), were collected. Independent T-tests, Wilcoxon Two-Sample tests, and Spearman's correlations were performed to assess renal and cardiac function relationships. Multivariate regression models were employed to evaluate predictors of LVEF over time. Results: Cardiac dysfunction was observed in 25% of the cohort, with significantly lower LVEF and fractional shortening compared to those without dysfunction. Patients with cardiac dysfunction were younger at CKD diagnosis (p < 0.0001), suggesting an earlier progression of renal and cardiac impairment. Following dialysis, eGFR significantly decreased in patients without cardiac dysfunction (p < 0.0001) but remained unchanged in those with dysfunction. Conversely, LVEF improved post-dialysis in patients with cardiac dysfunction (p = 0.0034) but remained stable in those with normal cardiac function. Prolonged dialysis duration was negatively correlated with eGFR (r = -0.31, p = 0.008) and LV mass (r = -0.26, p = 0.024). Hemodialysis duration was positively correlated with LVEF (r = 0.73, p < 0.001), suggesting potential cardiovascular benefits from prolonged hemodialysis treatment. Conclusions: Pediatric CKD patients, particularly those with cardiac dysfunction, experience significant alterations in both renal and cardiac parameters, requiring tailored dialysis strategies in this population."

The study focuses on how the differentiation of voices, as defined by the fundamental frequency (F0) shaped by biological sex and kinship, influences neurophysiological responses when measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Premature infants, who are highly sensitive to auditory stimuli, may benefit from music-based interventions; however, there is limited understanding of how voice variations between male and female caregivers, and whether they are biologically related, affect brain activity. Our protocol outlines a structured intervention where infants are exposed to singing by four facilitators - a male music therapist, a female music therapist, the mother, and the father - and includes two singing stages: a sustained note (A at 440 Hz) and a 90-second lullaby, both interspersed with silent periods to allow for baseline measurements. EEG recordings track brain activity throughout these sessions, followed by quantitative EEG (qEEG) analysis and thorough statistical computations (e.g., mixed-effects models, spectral power analysis, and post-hoc tests) to explore how these auditory stimuli influence brain function. Preliminary data from five infants show that maternal singing elicits the highest delta spectral power in all measured conditions except during the  lullaby song, where paternal singing elicits the highest effects followed by the male music therapist and then the mother. These early findings highlight the potential influence of parental voices, particularly the fathers voice, on neonatal brain development, while the detailed study protocol ensures rigor and replicability, providing a robust framework for future research. Additionally, this protocol lays the groundwork for exploring the long-term effects of music-based interventions, with the goal of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes in premature infants through tailored auditory stimulation.

While many CBD preparations have been studied in randomized clinical trials involving ASD, none have used purified CBD preparations or preparations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, nor have they focused on low-functioning children with ASD. Previous studies have identified several candidate electrophysiological biomarkers for the cognitive and behavioral disabilities in ASD, with one emerging biomarker being aperiodic neural activity. Here we examined whether periodic (oscillatory) and/or aperiodic electroencephalography (EEG) features are predictive of any symptomatic changes in ASD following pharmacological CBD intervention. To do this, we leveraged resting-state EEG from children with low-functioning ASD (24 boys, aged 7-14 years) using data obtained during a prior double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover Phase III Clinical Trial (NCT04517799) that investigated using cannabidiol to treat severe behavior problems in children with ASD. Using linear mixed effect models, we found that aperiodic EEG signal features varied directly with 7-COOH-CBD metabolite levels in blood, as evidenced by a larger aperiodic offset (p < 0.001) and decreased aperiodic exponent (p < 0.05) across the scalp. Furthermore, 7-COOH-CBD metabolite levels in blood had a positive association with nonverbal intelligence and visuomotor coordination (p < 0.05). Finally, changes in visuomotor coordination attributed to occipital oscillatory EEG activity were mediated by changes in 7-COOH-CBD metabolite levels in blood, with distinct effects observed for the delta frequency band (p < 0.05). Our analytical results suggest that this daily CBD preparation and administration schedule exerted some benefits, with improvements to cognitive and behavioral abilities in a low-functioning ASD children population. Our findings support the inclusion of resting-state, aperiodic signal features as candidate biomarkers for tracking the clinical impact of CBD treatment, in addition to traditional oscillatory EEG measures, within a neurodevelopmental context."

However, existing research has yielded mixed results, leaving many questions unanswered. We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization design to investigate whether GM directly influences multisite chronic pain (MCP) and eight phenotypes. We then used a combination of meta-analysis, genetic colocalization analysis, and Bayesian weighted mendelian randomization to further strengthen the evidence for causal relationship. Additionally, we examined how GM might be associated with human brain structures. Finally, we used mediation analysis to explore whether the structure and function of specific brain regions play a role in the relationship between GM and MCP and the pain phenotypes. We observed a significant causal association between 13 GM and chronic pain. Eight GM protected against pain phenotypes, whereas seven increased risk. The results indicate that GM could potentially affect the area, thickness, and volume of brain region cortices involved in sensory, emotional, and cognitive aspects of pain. Importantly, our findings indicated that the causal effect between the Genus Odoribacter and neck/shoulder pain could be mediated by the mean optical density in the left Fornix cres+Stria terminalis. In conclusion, different pain phenotypes were causally associated with different GM among European ancestry. Core GM may influence chronic pain by affecting complex brain networks. Notably, we constructed a basic gut-brain axis model for neck/shoulder pain, involving the Genus Odoribacter, left Fornix cres+Stria terminalis, and neck/shoulder pain."

The analysis employed chi-square tests and bivariate logistic regression to examine the association between self-perceived mental health, suicidal ideation, and socio-demographic factors. Results revealed significant associations between suicidal ideation, age group (p<.001), and sex (p<.001), with younger individuals (18-24 years) and females reporting a higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts. Also, bivariate logistic regression showed that being between the ages of 25 and 34 was a strong predictor of suicidal thoughts (OR = 1.954, p =.000), while being female (OR =.648, p =.000) and having a higher socioeconomic status (OR =.678, p =.000) were weaker predictors.

The gut bacterial ecosystem plays a key role in the host's energy metabolism, and potentially in the host's exercise capacity, recognized as a powerful predictor of health status and risk of mortality. Objective. To deepen our understanding of the gut bacterial ecosystem relationship with host's exercise capacity and energy metabolism, we characterized the gut microbiota in a cohort of healthy humans with heterogeneous exercise capacities, and next determined the impact of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from donors of this cohort on energy metabolism and exercise capacity of recipient mice. Design. 50 male normo-weight participants (from inactive to elite endurance athletes) performed food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and exercise tests to determine exercise capacity parameters (VO2max, fat oxidation, exercise energy expenditure). Metagenomic shotgun and metabolomic analyses were performed to characterize gut microbiota ecosystem and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) on human and mice fecal samples. Mice performed running exercise capacity tests and metabolic parameters were determined in skeletal muscle and plasma samples. Results. While our data support that the bacterial ecosystem appears to be modestly altered between individuals with low to high exercise capacities, we report that gut bacterial alpha-diversity, density, and functional richness are significantly reduced in athletes with very high exercise capacity. By using FMT, we report that the engraftment of these atypical gut microbiota improves insulin sensitivity and muscle glycogen stores into transfected mice. Conclusion. Our data highlight promising therapeutic perspectives in fecal transplantation from human donors selected based on exercise capacity parameters."

Methods Using a linear mixed-effects model adjusted for potential confounding factors, we analyzed 14 years of motor and cognitive assessments and five years of dopamine transporter imaging data from 878 PPMI participants to establish comprehensive progression profiles for sporadic PD (n=473), LRRK2 PD (n=275), and GBA PD (n=130). By introducing -syn SAA results from 586 participants (n=351 sporadic PD, 163 LRRK2 PD, and 72 GBA PD), we determined whether baseline -syn seeding positivity (95% sporadic PD, 69% LRRK2 PD, and 94% GBA PD) and the time to 50% of the maximum fluorescence (T50), an indicator of seed concentration, are associated with progression in PD. Findings Participants with sporadic PD (yearly change in MDS-UPDRS III: 1.50 points; 95% confidence interval 1.41-1.58) and GBA PD (1.52; 1.31-1.72)(p=0.873) progressed similarly while those with LRRK2 PD progressed slower (1.05; 0.89-1.20)(p<0.001).

Early screening is essential to enable timely treatment. In Bangladesh, access to screening services for NCDs is often limited. This study aimed to elicit the willingness to accept (WTA) and the willingness to pay (WTP) for four screening packages for NCDs and their association with the respondents sociodemographic characteristics among rural communities in Bangladesh. Methods A cross-sectional survey using contingent valuation was conducted in six villages of Faridpur district, Bangladesh. The WTP was elicited using a double-bounded dichotomous choice and bidding game approach, with initial bid amounts based on local market prices. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with WTA and WTP, and a two-part model was employed to estimate mean WTP and its determinants. We used a double-limit dichotomous choice model with the respondents who took part in the bidding exercise. Results We found that 83% of the 346 respondents were willing to accept at least one screening package and among these 44% would be willing to pay to accept all screenings. The willingness to accept and pay varied largely by the type of screening being offered, with much lower proportions for obesity than for hypertension and diabetes. The results suggested that individuals from households with a member with an NCD were more willing to accept and pay for screening compared to those from households without an NCD. Married individuals in the highest wealth and expenditure tertiles were also more willing to pay than not-married individuals from middle- and low-wealth and expenditure tertiles. Sex and occupation influenced the amount individuals were willing to pay. Conclusions Our results encourage the development of screening interventions for NCDs in rural populations. Further research is needed to assess their feasibility, effectiveness and equity in Bangladesh on a larger scale."

Ltd.'],"Background: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) to electrocardiograms (ECGs) has shown great promise in the screening and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, often matching or surpassing human expertise. However, the black-box nature of deep learning models poses significant challenges to their clinical adoption. While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Saliency Maps, have attempted to address these issues, they have not been able to provide clear, clinically relevant explanations. We developed the Generative Counterfactual ECG XAI (GCX) framework, which uses counterfactual scenarios to explain AI predictions, enhancing interpretability and aligning with medical knowledge. Methods: We designed a study to validate the GCX framework by applying it to eight AI-ECG models, including those focused on regression of six ECG features, potassium level regression, and atrial fibrillation (AF) classification. PTB-XL and MIMIC-IV were used to develop and test. GCX generated counterfactual (CF) ECGs to visualize how changes in the ECG relate to AI-ECG predictions. We visualized CF ECGs for qualitative comparisons, statistically compared ECG features, and validated these findings with conventional ECG knowledge. Results: The GCX framework successfully generated interpretable ECGs aligned with clinical knowledge, particularly in the context of ECG feature regression, potassium level regression, and AF classification. For ECG feature regression, GCX demonstrated clear and consistent changes in features, reflecting the corresponding morphological alterations. CF ECGs for hyperkalemia showed a prolonged PR, discernible P wave, increased T wave amplitude, and widened QRS complex, whereas those for AF demonstrated the disappearance of the P wave and irregular rhythms. Conclusion: The GCX framework enhances the interpretability of AI-ECG models, offering clear relevant explanations for AI predictions. This approach holds substantial potential for improving the trust and utility of AI in clinical practice, although further validation across diverse datasets is required."

This generally leads to a higher prevalence of oral infections, including periodontal disease. To date, no study has addressed this issue in a French population. Objective: The aim of the study, part of the PARKIDENT clinical trial, was to assess the periodontal health of people with PD and to evaluate changes in their periodontal parameters 6 months after receiving hygiene advice. Methods: Data were collected from 40 participants at both baseline and 6-month follow-up. These data included demographic information and an assessment of the participants' PD stage. Oral health assessments included oral hygiene and periodontal status. Microbiological samples were also collected and the data collected during the two visits were compared. Results: Forty people with PD participated in the study. An improvement in oral hygiene habits and a reduction in the plaque index were observed at follow-up. The frequency of patients with significant periodontal pockets (> 6mm) was also reduced (from 20% to 3%). The improvement in these periodontal parameters was associated with a reduction in bacterial load, particularly for Treponema denticola (p=0.003). Conclusion: The study suggests that hygiene advice can improve periodontal health in patients with PD, potentially preventing tooth loss and improving their quality of life. Clinical Significance: This study, the first in France on the periodontal health of people with PD, suggests that dental visits and hygiene advice can improve their oral health."

However, no microbiota or metabolite has been used for diagnosis or therapy of CA till now. METHODS: The microbial DNA was extracted from the stool samples of the CA and healthy volunteer groups. The 16S rDNA gene was sequenced on a MiSeq system. R software package was used to analyze the sequence, and the variations in microbial composition was obtained. The correlation analysis of the differential intestinal bacteria, metabolites and blood parameters was explored based on a logistic regression model. A random forest algorithm was used to predict the classification of samples for further exploring the relationship between fecal microbiota and CA. RESULTS: The -diversity indexes demonstrated an altered within-sample microbial diversities between patients and healthy people. The subsequent beta diversity results indicated that shift in the between-sample microbial diversities of the intestinal microbiota was associated with the occurrence of cerebral aneurysm. Specifically, the abundance of some gut bacterial genera, such as Blautia and Faecalibacterium, changed significantly after CA. Intestinal metabolite enrichment results highlight the role of carbohydrate metabolic pathways in CA, including sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (S-7-P). The correlation analysis of the differential intestinal bacteria, metabolites and blood parameters indicated that intestinal bacteria and metabolites were related to host blood parameters. Then, the predictive models were employed to test the significance of the combination of differential bacteria, metabolites and blood parameters in CA diagnosis and prognosis. The predictive model built by Faecalibacterium and s7p obtained an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 99.7%, and Faecalibacterium and s-7-p were also associated with some metabolite that have significance in post-surgery prognosis of CA. Conclusions: The gut microbiota and metabolites profiles of patients with CA were significantly altered.

There is an emerging interest in optimum hydration and identifying how factors such as ingestion rate and beverage composition affect hydration. This study examined three beverages with varying ingestion rates and measured markers of hydration. Methods: Thirty healthy, active participants between ages 18 to 45 years were given three different beverages on three separate days. The beverages were of identical volumes (1 Liter), but differed in the rate of ingestion, carbohydrate content and electrolyte content. Beverage 1 (Buoy, San Diego, CA) and water-alone were both consumed at a metered rate of one liter over four hours, whereas Beverage 2 was used as a positive control and consumed at a bolus rate of one liter in 30 minutes. Findings: After six hours Beverage 1 significantly improved markers of hydration compared to water-alone or Beverage 2. Beverage 1 decreased cumulative urine output vs water-alone by 32% (absolute difference 0.33L; CI 0.16 to 0.51) and vs Beverage 2 by 26% (absolute difference 0.26L; CI 0.13 to 0.38).

This study evaluated the performance of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), microscopy, and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in detecting malaria parasites among community members in five villages of Kyerwa district, Kagera region, an area where artemisinin partial resistance (ART-R) has been recently confirmed. Methods: A community cross-sectional survey of asymptomatic and symptomatic participants (n=4454) aged [&ge;]6 months was conducted in July and August 2023. Malaria infections were detected using RDTs, microscopy, and qPCR (using the 18S RNA gene). Performance of RDTs and microscopy was assessed by sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values, using qPCR as the reference method. Factors affecting the accuracy of these methods were explored using a multivariate logistic regression model. Results: The prevalence of malaria infections was 44.4% (n = 1979/4454), 32.1% (n = 1431/4454), and 39.8% (n = 1771/4454) by RDTs, microscopy, and qPCR, respectively. The prevalence of P. malariae and P. ovale mono-infection by microscopy was 0.2% (n = 7/4454) and 0.3% (n = 12/4454), while by qPCR was 0.4% (n = 16/4454) and 0.5% (n = 24/4454), respectively. The geometric mean parasite densities (GMPDs) by microscopy were 642 (95% confidence intervals (CI) = 570 - 723), 126 (95% CI = 98 - 162), and 124 (95% CI = 82 - 160) asexual parasites/[micro]L; while by qPCR, the GMPDs were 1180 (95% CI = 1032 - 1349), 44 (95% CI = 32 - 61), and 50 (95% CI = 29 - 89) parasites/[micro]L for P. falciparum, P. ovale spp, and P. malariae, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of RDTs were 94.0% (95% CI = 92.8% - 95.1%) and 87.5% (95% CI = 86.2% - 88.7%), respectively; whereas those of microscopy were 74.6% (95% CI = 72.5% - 76.6%) and 95.2% (95% CI = 94.3% - 96.0%), respectively.

Conclusion: A higher prevalence of malaria was detected and the performance of RDTs and qPCR were comparable, but microscopy had a lower performance. Higher sensitivity by RDTs compared to microscopy, indicates that RDTs are effective for the detection of malaria infections for routine case management and surveillance of malaria in this area with confirmed ART-R; and can be utilized in the ongoing plans to develop a response to ART-R."

This study explores how workflow processes within HIV clinics, among data scientists, and within state health departments may introduce and minimize bias within EHRs. Methods: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, in-depth individual interviews were conducted with 16 participants purposively sampled in South Carolina from August 2023-April 2024. A focus group with 3 health department professionals with expertise in HIV disease surveillance was also conducted. Analysis was conducted as outlined by Charmaz (2006). Results: To reduce bias in EHR data, information entry forms should be designed to expansively include patient self-reported social determinants of health (SDOH) information. During data collection, healthcare providers should create a supportive healthcare environment, facilitate SDOH information disclosure, and accurately document patient information. Patients should have access to their EHRs to confirm that SDOH information are correctly recorded. During data curation, data scientists should inspect datasets for completeness, accuracy, and educate public health researchers on dataset limitations. During data management and utilization, health department professionals should crossmatch data across the state, customize data collection systems to reflect local needs, and provide community-based data education and stigma management.

It is uncertain how best to promote self-management approaches or the actions that patients and carers take to maintain physical and mental health, in this context. This review aims to identify, critically appraise, and synthesize qualitative evidence that describes self-management of multimorbidity among patients and their carers in SSA. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL Global Health, Google Scholar and grey literature for studies on self-management of multimorbidity or common individual chronic diseases (HIV, diabetes, hypertension or chronic kidney disease) in SSA published between 1 January 2000 and 28 to 15th September 2024. Using qualitative meta-synthesis techniques to formulate the questions and synthesize findings. We used a 10-point Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP)-Qualitative-Checklist to assess the quality of the studies and NVivo 12 software to facilitate a thematic analysis approach. Results We screened 2010 articles for inclusion and 20 studies met inclusion criteria. We identified themes related to medical, diet, emotional and physical self-management activities. Patients negotiate self-management based on immediacy of needs and available family support. Patients are motivated to apply biomedical management but are limited by factors such as drug stock-outs and out-of-pocket expenditure. Limited knowledge and low self-efficacy toward self-management of multimorbidity impact decision making and problem solving. We found that diabetes mellitus presents the biggest stressor in terms of burden of treatment; temporal discontinuation of medications is more prevalent amongst patients with hypertension; and patients with multimorbidity are frequently hypervigilant about their health, more likely to suffer from stress and to seek healthcare.     Conclusions We found that there is relative lack of data on self-management of multimorbidity among patients and their carers in SSA. Where data exists, we observed significant health literacy gaps, low health literacy support and limited self-efficacy as barriers to implementation of self-management. Context sensitive programmes are required to improve health literacy to increase patient autonomy and their toolkit of options to manage chronic disease."

Event related functional MRI (fMRI) was used to assess sustained attention performance and associated brain activations by comparing VPT (n = 34) and their age matched full term (FT, n = 28) peers from a previously validated continuous performance task with gradual onset (gradCPT) paradigm, using two different modality versions (i.e., face and scene). In both groups, linear regression analyses were performed to examine associations between attentional and socio emotional difficulties and brain activations related to sustained attention. Results show preserved sustained attention processes in VPT adolescents, indicated by comparable behavioral attentional performance and cerebral patterns of activations in both groups across the two modalities of the gradCPT. In addition, VPT adolescents showed over recruitments in posterior occipital areas compared to FT adolescents. Moreover, higher socio emotional difficulties (i.e., higher anxiety and social difficulties) in VPT were linked to altered activations specifically in the right middle frontal gyrus, occipito temporal gyri and bilateral cerebellum, but exclusively observed during the face modality of the gradCPT. Overall, these results suggest that despite preserved sustained attention competences, VPT adolescents present a less mature sustained attention cerebral network, particularly during a task with a social context."

Based on the hypothesis that many collagen peptides are derived not from the full, mature collagen molecule, but from (larger) collagen degradation products, relationships between COL1A1 peptides containing identical sequences were investigated, with the smaller (offspring) peptide being a possible degradation product of the larger (parent) one. The strongest correlations were found for relationships where the parent differed by a maximum of 3 amino acids from the offspring, indicating an exopeptidase-regulated stepwise degradation process. Regression analysis indicated that CKD affects this degradation process. Comparison of matched CKD patients and control individuals (n=612 each) showed that peptides at the start of the degradation process were consistently downregulated in CKD, indicating an attenuation of COL1A1 endopeptidase-mediated degradation. However, as these peptides undergo further degradation, likely mediated by exopeptidases, this downregulation can become less significant or even reverse, leading to an upregulation of later stage fragments and potentially explaining the inconsistencies observed in previous studies."

However, adults with diabetes in the highest quintile of UPF intake had a significantly higher risk of LC (HR = 2.44; 95% CI: 1.27, 4.67) compared to participants without diabetes. A small excess risk due to the interaction between UPF and diabetes (0.13; 95% CI -0.32, 0.58) was observed, resulting in an additional 201 cases of LC per 105 person-years (95% CI: 70, 332) attributed to the highest UPF intake and diabetes interaction. Furthermore, a 10% increment in UPF intake (%kcal/day) increased the risk of LC by 32%. Conclusions: While UPF, in terms of weight contribution, is associated with a higher risk of LC in participants with diabetes, UPF (in %kcal/day), is associated with an increased risk of LC in all participants. Lowering UPF intake may help reduce the risk of LC in both diabetic patients and the general population."

However, there lacks a comprehensive study of hYS nutrient-gene interactions. Here we performed a secondary analysis of hYS transcript profiles (n=9 samples) to identify nutrient-sensitive hYS genes and regulatory networks, including those that associate with adverse perinatal phenotypes with embryonic origins. Overall, 14.8% highly expressed hYS genes are nutrient-sensitive; the most common nutrient cofactors for hYS genes are metals and B-vitamins. Functional analysis of highly expressed hYS genes reveals that nutrient-sensitive hYS genes are more likely to be involved in metabolic functions than hYS genes that are not nutrient-sensitive. Through nutrient-sensitive gene network analysis, we find that four nutrient-sensitive transcription regulators in the hYS (with zinc and/or magnesium cofactors) are predicted to collectively regulate 30.9% of highly expressed hYS genes. Lastly, we identify 117 nutrient-sensitive hYS genes that associate with an adverse perinatal outcome with embryonic origins. Among these, the greatest number of nutrient-sensitive hYS genes are linked to congenital heart defects (n=54 genes), followed by microcephaly (n=37). Collectively, our study characterises nutrient-sensitive hYS functions and improves understanding of the ways in which nutrient-gene interactions in the hYS may influence both typical and pathological development."

Current phenotyping strategies for DCT rely on heterogeneous combinations of procedural and diagnostic codes, leading to concerns about misclassification. We aimed to create universal phenotypic algorithms to classify DCT status across EHR systems. Methods: Using Vanderbilt University Medical Center's de-identified EHR system, we developed and validated two sets of algorithms - one requiring imaging verification and one without imaging verification - to identify DCT cases and controls. The algorithms used combinations of ICD and CPT codes, as well as natural language processing (NLP), to increase diagnostic certainty. Manual chart reviews by trained personnel blinded to case-control determinations were conducted to compute positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV). Results: The algorithm development process resulted in five phenotypes with an overall predictive value of 94.5%. By approach: 1) code only cases that required imaging confirmation (PPV = 89%), 2) code only cases that did not require imaging verification (PPV = 92%), 3) NLP-based cases that did not require imaging verification (PPV = 89%), 4) code-based controls that were confirmed by imaging (NPV = 90%), and 5) code and NLP-based controls that did not require imaging verification (NPV = 100%). External validation demonstrated 94% sensitivity and 75% specificity for the code-only algorithms. The addition of NLP increased the number of identified cases without compromising predictive values. Conclusions: These algorithms represent an improvement over current phenotyping strategies and allows for EHR studies of unprecedented size"

However, concurrent gabapentin and opioid prescriptions have been associated with greater risk of respiratory depression in some studies. Purpose: To compare the risk of respiratory events among Medicare enrollees with spine-related diagnoses treated with gabapentin + opioids vs those treated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or duloxetine + opioids. We hypothesized that enrollees treated with gabapentin + opioids would have increased risk of adverse respiratory events compared to those treated with an active control + opioids. Study Design/Setting: Propensity score-matched cohort study with an incident user, active comparator (TCA/duloxetine) control design. The primary analysis included those who concurrently (within 30 days) filled [&ge;]1 incident gabapentin + [&ge;]1 opioid or [&ge;]1 incident TCA/duloxetine + [&ge;]1 opioid prescription. Patient Sample: U.S. Medicare beneficiaries with spine-related diagnoses 2017-2019. People treated with gabapentin + opioids (n=66,580) were matched on demographic and clinical factors to people treated with TCAs/duloxetine + opioids (n=66,580). Outcome Measures: Time to a composite respiratory outcome consisting of mechanical ventilation, intubation, respiratory failure, pneumonia, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Methods: Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Results: Among 133,160 Medicare enrollees (median age 73.3 years; 66.7% female), 6089 (4.6%) experienced respiratory events before the end of follow-up. A total of 3297 (5.0%) of people who were treated with gabapentin + opioids (median initial dose/day of gabapentin was 338 mg) had respiratory events compared to 2792 (4.2%) of those treated with an active control + opioids. The increased risk in those treated with gabapentin + opioids was statistically significant after adjustment (HR 1.14; 95% CI 1.09, 1.20; p<0.0001). The most common respiratory events were pneumonia (3.5% of people in the gabapentin + opioids group versus 3.0% of people in the TCA/duloxetine + opioids group) and respiratory failure (2.2% in the gabapentin + opioids group versus 1.8% in the TCA/duloxetine + opioids group). Results were similar in analyses (a) restricted to [&le;]30-day follow-up and (b) that required [&ge;]2 fills of each prescription. Conclusions: While recent work has indicated no increased mortality risk with concurrent gabapentin and opioid use, the current findings suggest clinicians should exercise caution in prescribing gabapentin to people experiencing pain who are also being treated with opioids, due to the potentially increased risk of respiratory events."

Although the number of diagnosed cases is rising, current understanding of the CASK-related neurodevelopmental spectrum is limited. Here, we systematically review the published characteristics of individuals with CASK-related disorder, and compare these to a more recently-diagnosed group. We provide quantitative information about the ranges of adaptive abilities, motor function, visual function and social-emotional-behavioural characteristics, and explore within-group associations. Methods: 151 individuals with CASK variants were identified in published literature. 31 children and young people with CASK variants were recruited to the UK-based Brain and Behaviour in Neurodevelopmental disorder of Genetic Origin (BINGO) project. BINGO-participating caregivers completed a bespoke medical history questionnaire and battery of standardised neurodevelopmental measures. Results: Comparing the recently diagnosed BINGO CASK-related disorder group to previously reported individuals, we found consistent prevalence of tone abnormalities, sensorineural hearing loss and epilepsy, but lower prevalence of severe/profound ID, MICPCH, optic atrophy and nystagmus. Areas of frequent difficulty not highlighted in previous reports include sleep difficulties and cerebral visual impairment (CVI). Neurodevelopmental characteristics were highly variable within the BINGO CASK-related disorder group, and group-wide patterns were similar to those observed in other rare genetic conditions. Within the BINGO CASK-related group, epilepsy is significantly associated with ID severity, after controlling for age. Sub-groups with MICPCH or microcephaly only have equivalent ranges of adaptive function, but MICPCH may be associated with more severe motor difficulties. Conclusion: The spectrum of neurodevelopmental characteristics associated with CASK-related disorder appears to be broadening with increased access to genome-wide diagnostic testing. Further studies are needed to elucidate the relationships between CASK variants, structural brain development, epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental characteristics."

We observed genetic correlations between DD and 73 behavioral, physical and neuroimaging traits, many of which persisted even after accounting for educational attainment, intelligence, and executive function. Network analysis revealed that the associations between DD and certain traits were explained by both overlapping and trait-specific biological processes.

Short-read genome sequencing (srGS) and long-read genome sequencing (lrGS) both provide exonic single nucleotide variant (SNV) and small indel detection at the same sensitivity as ES, but also evaluate intronic regions. lrGS provides improved resolution for structural variants (SV) and repetitive genomic regions. We sought to investigate the potential utility of lrGS in the diagnostic evaluation of a small cohort of patients with SNHL of unknown etiology after ES and srGS. 19 pediatric patients with SNHL underwent lrGS via PacBio SMRT sequencing. Sequencing data were processed using the PacBio WGS variant pipeline. The diagnostic yield for this lrGS cohort was 4/19 (21%). Relevant variants detected only with lrGS included a hemizygous deletion in trans with a missense variant in an area of high genomic homology (OTOA) and two single nucleotide loss-of-function variants in trans to a known copy-number-loss for a gene with a highly homologous pseudogene (STRC). A complex inversion was identified in the MITF gene which was also identified on post-hoc analysis by srGS.

In the United States, GS for adults and children is recommended to include a list of ""secondary findings"" genes (ACMG SF v3.2) that are associated with disorders for which surveillance or treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. The genes on ACMG SF v3.2 predominantly cause adult-onset disorders. Importantly, many genetic disorders with fetal and infantile onset are actionable as well. A proposed solution is to create a ""fetal actionable findings list,"" which can be offered to pregnant patients undergoing fetal GS or eventually, as a standalone cell-free fetal DNA screening test.

The joint cancer models highlight significant clustering of cancer types, including a near complete overlap in susceptibility genes for breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancer.

In Sweden, the yearly incidence is between 1000 and 1500 people, which is higher than the global average. Understanding the economic burden of suicide could help highlight the importance and urgency of finding more effective treatments and preventative measures to help people suffering from suicidal thoughts and support studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of various interventions.   Method: This national population-based cross-sectional study estimated the indirect costs associated with all suicides in Sweden between 2010 and 2019. Indirect costs were estimated using the human capital approach. Data regarding average salaries and employment rates were extracted from publicly available data in Sweden. Productivity loss was estimated over two time horizons, the year following the suicide and over a lifetime horizon. Estimations were performed in total numbers for the yearly cohorts as well as per person.   Results: Between 2010 and 2019, 1 406 to 1 591 suicides occurred every year in Sweden. In total, approximately 26 500 productive life years are lost every year due to suicide. In 2019, the productivity loss due to all suicides in Sweden was estimated to be 44 million euros over a one-year time horizon, where 10 million euros are direct losses in local and regional authority taxes. Over a lifetime, productivity losses amounted to 935 million euros. The corresponding estimations per person were 37 and 778 thousand euros respectively over a one-year and a lifetime time horizon Over a one-year time horizon, the productivity loss was highest in the older age groups.   Conclusions: This study provides valuable insights into the economic burden of suicide on Swedish society. It underlines the potential economic benefits of effective suicide prevention, aligning with previous research highlighting the substantial returns--both monetary and in terms of human well-being--that successful prevention strategies can yield."

Setting: University of California, San Francisco. Participants: 100 randomly selected Inpatient Hospital Medicine encounters of 3-6 days duration between 2019-2022. Exposure: Blinded evaluation of physician- and LLM-generated narratives was performed in duplicate by 22 attending physician reviewers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Narratives were reviewed for overall quality, reviewer preference, comprehensiveness, concision, coherence, and three error types - inaccuracies, omissions, and hallucinations. Each error individually, and each narrative overall, were assigned potential harmfulness scores on a 0-7 adapted AHRQ scale. Results: Across 100 encounters, LLM- and physician-generated narratives were comparable in overall quality on a 1-5 Likert scale (average 3.67 [SD 0.49] vs 3.77 [SD 0.57], p=0.213) and reviewer preference ({chi}2 = 5.2, p=0.270). LLM-generated narratives were more concise (4.01 [SD 0.37] vs. 3.70 [SD 0.59]; p<0.001) and more coherent (4.16 [SD 0.39] vs. 4.01 [SD 0.53], p=0.019) than their physician-generated counterparts, but less comprehensive (3.72 [SD 0.58] vs. 4.13 [SD 0.58]; p<0.001). LLM-generated narratives contained more unique errors (average 2.91 [SD 2.54] errors per summary) than physician-generated narratives (1.82 [SD 1.94]). Averaged across individual errors, there was no significant difference in the potential for harm between LLM- and physician-generated narratives (1.35 [SD 1.07] vs 1.34 [SD 1.05], p=0.986). Both LLM- and physician-generated narratives had low overall potential for harm (<1 on 0-7 scale), although LLM-generated narratives scored higher than physician narratives (0.84 [SD 0.98] vs 0.36 [SD 0.70], p<0.001). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of 100 inpatient Hospital Medicine encounters, LLM-generated discharge summary narratives were of similar quality, and were preferred equally, to those generated by physicians. LLM-generated summaries were more likely to contain errors but had low overall harmfulness scores.

We newly adopted domain embedding (DE) to simplify pretraining procedure and to improve comprehension of medical context. ADE prediction was selected as a finetuning task. For drug groups, we included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), anticoagulants (AC), glucocorticoids (GC), and chemotherapy (Chemo). For corresponding adverse events, we selected peptic ulcer (PU), intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), osteoporosis (OP), and neutropenic fever (NF), respectively. CDM-BERT was validated by internal and external datasets with 510,879 and 419,505 adult inpatients. CDM-BERT outperformed all the other baselines in all cohorts, demonstrating the effectiveness of DE (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.977, 0.908, 0.980, 0.989 for NSAID-PU, AC-ICH, GC-OP, Chemo-NF cohorts in internal validation, and 0.967, 0.960, 0.972, 0.959 in external validation, respectively). We also identified important features for each cohort, and several prior studies and clinical knowledge suggested the results. CDM-BERT has demonstrated its potential as a foundation model through its prediction performance, interpretability, and compatibility."

At present, CH is identified by targeted sequencing of peripheral blood DNA, which is impractical to apply at population scale. The complete blood count (CBC) is an inexpensive, widely used clinical test. Here, we explore whether machine learning (ML) approaches applied to CBC data could predict individuals likely to harbour CH and prioritise them for DNA sequencing. Methods The UK Biobank was filtered to identify 431,531 participants with paired CBC and whole exome sequencing (WES). Somatic mutations were previously identified from blood WES using Mutect2 to classify individuals with CH driver mutations. Using 18 CBC indices/features and basic demographics (age and sex), we trained a range of tree-based ML classifiers to infer as binary output, the presence/ absence of CH. Findings Using Random Forest (RF) classifiers, we predicted the presence/absence of CH driven by mutations in one of five genes known to confer a high-risk of incident MN (JAK2, CALR, SF3B1, SRSF2 and U2AF1). We subsequently developed a unified, optimised RF classifier for high-risk CH driven by any of these genes and assessed its performance (median AUC 0.85). However, the low prevalence of high-risk CH implies that our model cannot be generalised to population scale without compromising its sensitivity (20.1% using stringent cutoff probability score). Interpretation We showcase a proof-of-concept that the presence of high-risk CH can be inferred from CBC perturbations using RF classifiers. The future integration of raw blood cell analyser data can help improve the performance of our model and facilitate its application at scale."

Self-collection of rectal specimens is widely used globally, but limited data exist on its implementation in Africa. We report experiences of MSM/TGW self-collecting rectal STI specimens in Kigali. Methods From March to August 2018, 738 MSM/TGW were recruited in a cross-sectional study using respondent-driven sampling in Kigali. We tested for Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis using the Cepheid GeneXpert CT/NG platform on self-collected rectal swabs. Likert scales assessed self-collection difficulty and comfort. Ordered logistic regression analyses were performed to characterize factors associated with self-collection difficulty. Results Overall, 14%(106) identified as TGW. In total, 78%(577) found rectal swab self-collection easy/very easy, while 15%(108) found it difficult/very difficult. Most, 92%(679), were comfortable/very comfortable with the test, and 98%(730) said they would repeat the test in the future. In multivariable RDS-adjusted analyses, discomfort with the swab was positively associated with difficulty in self-collection (adjusted cumulative odds ratios ((aCOR): 7.9(95%CI: 4.9-12.8)) and having a prevalent rectal STI (aCOR: 4.19, 95%CI: 2.02-8.72) was significantly associated with difficulty. Furthermore, 10%(75) of rectal swabs returned indeterminate results (65 invalid results and 10 errors). Conclusion Most MSM/TGW found self-collection of rectal swabs easy, comfortable, and collected valid samples. Self-collection of rectal swabs could be used alongside clinic- and community-based STI testing to improve diagnosis and treatment in Rwanda. However, measures to optimize sample collection and processing are needed to reduce the cost and clinical implications of indeterminate results"

We measured salivary cortisol and pulse rate as indicators of a physiological stress response, and anxiety ratings as an indicator of an affective stress response at multiple time points. Baseline oxytocin levels did not significantly differ between the groups. However, our results suggest an altered association of oxytocin and affective stress responses in participants with AUD: while participants with AUD showed a positive relationship between plasmatic oxytocin levels and stress-induced anxiety increase, the opposite relationship was found in control participants. We did not find evidence for an association of oxytocin with physiological stress responses. Assuming that affective stress responses mediate addiction-related behaviors like craving and relapse, our findings suggest that administering exogenous oxytocin might not be beneficial in treating AUD, at least during the early stages of abstinence."

Carotid stenosis is a key source of embolic strokes. Carotid interventions can be indicated when a patient has greater than 50% stenosis in the carotid ipsilateral to the cerebral infarction, which is designated as the symptomatic carotid. However, there are often significant number of cases where carotid emboli travel contralaterally leading to ambiguity regarding which carotid is symptomatic. We use a patient-specific computational embolus-hemodynamics interaction model developed in prior works to conduct an in silico experiment spanning 30 heart-to-brain arterial models with differing combinations of bilateral severe and mild stenosis degrees. We used these models to study source-to-destination transport of thromboemboli released from left/right carotid disease sites, and cardiogenic sources. Across all cases considered, thromboemboli from left and right carotid sources showed non-zero contralateral transport. We also found that cardiogenic thromboemboli do not have an altered hemisphere distribution or distinct transport preference dependent on stenosis degree, thus potentially making the underlying etiology more cryptic. In patients with carotid stenosis or chronic occlusion ipsilateral to the area affected by stroke, we have demonstrated that the presence of contralateral stenosis can cause emboli that travel across the Circle of Willis (CoW) which can potentially lead to ambiguity when deciding which carotid is truly symptomatic."

Objective: To investigate associations between demographic data and age at first keratoplasty in a large genetically refined FECD cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study recruited 894 individuals with FECD at Moorfields Eye Hospital (London) and General University Hospital (Prague). Ancestry was inferred from genome-wide SNP array data. CTG18.1 status was determined by short tandem repeat and/or triplet-primed PCR. One or more expanded alleles (>49 repeats) were classified as expansion-positive (Exp+). Expansion-negative (Exp-) cases were whole exome sequenced. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Association between variants in FECD-associated genes, demographic data and age at first keratoplasty. Results: Within the total cohort (n=894), 77.3% were Exp+. The majority of European (668/829, 80.6%) and South Asian (14/22, 63.6%) patients were Exp+, whereas the majority of those with African (30/37, 81.1%), East Asian (2/3,66.7%), and American Admixture (2/3, 66.7%) ancestry were Exp-. The percentage of females was significantly higher (151, 74.4%) in the Exp- cohort compared to the Exp+ (395, 57.2%; P<.001). The median (IQR) age at first keratoplasty of the Exp+ patients (68.2 [63.2 to 73.6] years) was older than the Exp- patients (61.3 [52.6 to 70.4] years; P<.001). The CTG18.1 repeat length of the largest expanded allele within the Exp+ group was inversely correlated with the age at first keratoplasty (r = -0.087 [95% CI: -0.162 to -0.012], P=.02). The ratio of biallelic to monoallelic expanded alleles was higher in the FECD cohort compared to an unaffected control group (P<.001), indicating that two Exp+ alleles increase disease penetrance compared to one expansion. We only identified potentially pathogenic variants (MAF <0.01; CADD >15) in FECD-associated genes in 13 (10.1%) Exp- individuals. Conclusions and Relevance: CTG18.1 expansions are present in most European and South Asian patients with FECD. Repeat length and zygosity status of CTG18.1 modify disease severity and penetrance. Known disease-associated genes account for only a minority of Exp- cases, with unknown risk factors determining disease in the rest of this subgroup. These data have important implications for the development of future FECD gene-targeted therapies."

A young female patient (age: 16-20 years old) presenting with periodic high fever, extensive urticaria/eczema, and marked eosinophilia was diagnosed with Gleich syndrome. The symptoms were severe, with no spontaneous remission, but responded well to oral steroids, showing mild resolution. WGS analysis of the patient's blood samples identified high-impact pathogenic mutations in 16 genes, including PRDM16. RNA-seq analysis revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with immune response regulation and viral defense. Combined z-score analysis of WGS and RNA-seq data identified ACE as a key gene. ACE expression was markedly downregulated during disease progression and recovered with treatment. IFNG was also identified. The results of this study suggest that a marked decrease in ACE, driven by genetic mutations in PRDM16 and altered expression of IFNG, leading to increased bradykinin and enhanced activation of the arachidonic acid cascade, may have caused the clinical presentation of Gleich syndrome, including dramatic inflammation and angioedema. This study underscores the importance of integrating WGS and RNA-seq data to elucidate the molecular basis of rare diseases and provides a foundation for developing therapeutic strategies for hypereosinophilic conditions."

Recent efforts to establish reliable brain circuit-symptom relationships and thus predict response have involved mapping with multiple intracranial electrodes, but the impracticality of this approach currently prevents its application at scale. In the present study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT05697172; FDA Q220192) we begin to address this gap by leveraging low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU), a novel noninvasive technique, to modulate the anterior limb of the internal capsule, which is an established surgical deep white matter target for depression. We based our study on burgeoning in vitro evidence that LIFU attenuates axonal conduction by operating mechanosensitive channels in nodes of Ranvier. Compared with sham stimulus, active LIFU produced a functional disconnection of gray matter hubs reached by the sonicated axonal tracts, an increase in positive emotion, and top-down effects on the cardiovascular autonomic balance. Our results using LIFU of deep-brain white matter tracts in humans open three potential avenues to understand the mechanisms and improve the outcome of depression, namely attaining a personalized definition of brain circuit-symptom relationships, serving as a noninvasive probe for neuromodulation before irreversible procedures in a ""try before you buy"" approach, and ultimately emerging as a therapeutic intervention itself."

Its immersive nature and diverse community may impact youth users' mental health, yet no research has explored this. This study is a thematic exploration of VRChat's effect on youth mental health. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 active VRChat users aged 18-24 years. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory principles to identify themes related to VRChat use and mental health. Results: Nine major themes emerged: Frequency of use; purpose of use; positive effects on mental health; negative effects on mental health; social connection and COVID-19; anonymity; cyberbullying and toxic behaviors; addiction; and recommendations for a safer environment. Positive effects identified included enhanced social connection, creative expression, and self-confidence. Negative effects included addiction, cyberbullying, predatory behaviors, and worsening of existing mental illnesses. The anonymity of VRChat created a paradoxical environment that can foster both genuine self-expression and toxic behaviors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, VRChat served as an important substitute for real-life social interactions. Participants also provided recommendations for developers, parents, and clinicians to promote a safer VRChat experience. Conclusion: The immersive and interactive social experience offered by VRChat is conducive for positive effects on youth users' mental health, such as social connectivity and self-expression. However, it also presents risks such as addiction and toxic behaviors. Given the interactive nature of VRChat, further research may elucidate its potential as a psychotherapeutic intervention for youth mental health."

However, studies demonstrating the sensitivity of 39K MRI or MRS to detect potassium alterations in disease or upon intervention are sparse. This study utilizes 39K MRS to non-invasively track real-time intramuscular potassium changes during exercise, providing an assessment of potassium dynamics and explores the potential for technical artifacts in the measurements. Methods: Five healthy subjects (three males, two females) were recruited to perform standardized dynamic knee extensions inside a 7T MR scanner. Potassium levels were measured using a 39K MRS protocol that included periods of rest, moderate, and heavy exercise followed by recovery. Additionally, possible measurement artifacts due to muscle movement or changes in coil position relative to the thigh were evaluated using 39K MRS and 1H MRI monitoring in separate sessions. Results: The study revealed a consistent decrease in potassium levels during both moderate and heavy exercise, with an average decrease of 5-6%. These changes were rapidly detectable and were reversed upon cessation of exercise, indicating effective in vivo monitoring capability. Possible experimental artifacts were investigated, and the results suggested not to be responsible for the detected potassium changes during exercise. The results of the non-localized 39K MRS measurements during exercise correlated well with expected physiological changes based on previous literature. Discussion: The application of 39K MRS provides a valuable non-invasive tool for studying potassium dynamics in human skeletal muscle. This technique could enhance our understanding of muscle physiology and metabolic disorders. The ability to measure these changes in real time and non-invasively highlights the potential for clinical applications, including monitoring of diseases affecting muscle and cellular metabolism."

Mathematical models have been used to simulate their transmission and control strategies, and the recent observation of a meningitis vaccine being partially effective against gonorrhoea has led to an increased modeling interest. Here we conducted a systematic review of the literature, focusing on studies that model vaccination strategies against Neisseria incidence and antimicrobial resistance. Using journal, preprint, and grey literature repositories, we identified 52 studies that we reviewed for validity, model approaches and assumptions. Most studies showed a good quality of evidence, and the variety of approaches along with their different modeling angles, was assuring especially for gonorrhoea studies. We identified options for future research, including the combination of both meningococcal and gonococcal infections in studies to have better estimates for vaccine benefits, and the spill over of gonorrhoea infections from the heterosexual to the MSM community and vice versa. Cost-effectiveness studies looking at at-risk and the wider populations can then be used to inform vaccine policies on gonorrhoea, as they have for meningococcal disease."

Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies evaluating, mpMRI, PSMA PET/CT, MRE, MRSI, BS, CT, PET, and other tracers for prostate cancer detection. Data on sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and detection rate were extracted and analyzed using NMA. Result: Across 123 studies involving 9,371 patients, 68Ga-P16-093 PET/CT and 68Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT showed high diagnostic accuracy in early-phase prostate cancer. For lymph node metastasis, 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI was most sensitive, 18F-DCFPyL PET/CT had the highest specificity and PPV, while 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT had the highest NPV. In bone metastasis, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/MRI excelled in sensitivity and NPV, while 18F-Fluciclovine PET/CT had the highest specificity and PPV. For biochemical recurrence, 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT had the highest lesion detection rate, and for different radiotracers, 18F-PSMA-1007 had the highest detection rate. Conclusion: This network meta-analysis comprehensively evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of various imaging modalities for prostate cancer across different stages. Our findings underscore the strengths and limitations of each imaging technique in detecting and staging prostate cancer."

Beta-blockers (BBs) are commonly prescribed to mitigate CV mortality in this population despite potential risks associated with OH. This study examines the impact of BBs on CV mortality among dialysis patients with OH. Methods: We conducted a prospective analysis of 134 dialysis patients from the PRECADIA program at the Centro de Educacion Medica e Investigaciones Clinicas (CEMIC) focusing on hemodynamic assessments including blood pressure changes from supine to standing positions and evaluating CV mortality over a 3-year follow-up. OH was defined by a decrease of 10 mmHg or more in diastolic blood pressure or 20 mmHg or more in systolic blood pressure upon standing. Cox regression analyses were utilized to identify independent predictors of CV mortality. Results: Of the patients, 23.1% were identified with OH. No significant differences in demographic or baseline clinical characteristics were observed between patients with and without OH, except for a higher diabetes prevalence in the OH group. OH patients treated with BBs demonstrated significantly higher CV mortality (29.6%) compared to those not receiving BBs. Independent predictors of CV mortality included age, time on dialysis, and BB use, with BBs significantly associated with increased CV mortality risk. Conclusions: Dialysis patients with OH exhibit a high CV mortality rate significantly influenced by BB usage. While BBs are recommended for managing CV risks in dialysis patients, their association with increased CV mortality in patients with OH necessitates careful consideration and management strategies."

Relationships between decreased PPS, skill acquisition, and performance are not well understood partly due to differences between measurement modalities of PPS. During assessments, individual joints are often constrained to a single plane of movement. We introduce ways to estimate PPS, simultaneously from multiple upper limb joints during unconstrained pose matching tasks, using 3D kinematics. Methods: Nineteen children with USCP, 14 age-matched typically developing children (TDC) and, 16 typically developed adults (TDA) were recruited. Participants performed contralateral upper limb pose matching tasks while blindfolded. Using 3D kinematic data extracted by a VICON Nexus motion-capture system, three ways of measuring matching performance were calculated: joint angle symmetry, joint distance symmetry, and orientation symmetry. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to statistically compare scores between groups. Spearman's rank correlation was used to investigate relationships between PPS symmetry measures and hand function in children with USCP. Results: Children with USCP presented significantly lower angle, distance, and orientation symmetries compared to TDC. TDA scores were not statistically significantly different compared to TDC. In children with USCP, orientation symmetry measures strongly correlated with several clinical hand function scores such as the box and blocks test. Conclusions:We introduced a new way to conveniently measure multi-joint PPS. Children with USCP presented lower PPS estimates compared to TDC. We also observed that orientation symmetry (limb coordination) strongly correlates with hand function."

Current therapeutic trials investigate treatments that can potentially modify the disease course. Testing their efficiency requires frequent and precise clinical outcome assessments (COA) of symptoms that remain problematic under symptomatic treatments, such as gait and balance. Home-based examinations may enhance patient compliance and, in addition, produce more reliable results by assessing patients more regularly in their familiar surroundings. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of a digitized COA designed to video record the Timed up and Go (vTUG) test at home via a study-specific smartphone app for patients with PD. Method: In this study, 28 patients were recruited and asked to perform at home each week a set of three consecutive vTUG tests over a period of 12 weeks using an app. The videos were subjected to a manual review to ascertain the durations of the individual vTUG phases, as well as to identify any errors or deviations in the setup that might have influenced the result. To evaluate the usability and user-friendliness of the vTUG and app, the System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) were administered to patients at the study end. Results: Overall, 19 patients completed the 12-week study, 17 of which recorded 10 videos or more. A total of 706 vTUGs with complete timings were recorded. Random Forest Regression yielded time to walk up as the most important segment of the vTUG for predicting the total time. Variance of vTUG total time was significantly higher between weeks than it was between the three consecutive vTUGs at one time point [F(254,23) = 6.50, p < 0.001]. The correlation between vTUG total time and UPDRS III total score was weak (r = 0.24). Yet, correlation between vTUG and a derived gait subscore (UPDRS III items 9-13) was strong (r = .59). A linear mixed-effects model revealed a significant effect of patient-reported motion status on vTUG total time. Including additional variables such as UPDRS III gait subscore, different footwear, and chairs used, further improved the model fit. Conclusion: Assessment of gait and balance by home-based vTUG is feasible. Factors influencing the read-out were identified and could be controlled for future use and longitudinal trials."

Our findings indicate that lung cancer BMs predominantly localize in the cerebellum, as well as the frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal lobes. Breast cancer BMs are commonly found in the cerebellum, frontal, occipital, and temporal lobes, while melanoma BMs are most frequently located in the occipital, temporal, and frontal lobes. Kidney cancer BMs, less studied in existing literature, primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes. Additionally, we explored the relationship between BM volume and tumor type, revealing that lung and breast cancer BMs are more likely to have smaller tumor volumes compared to melanoma and kidney cancer BMs. These findings confirm and expand upon previous research, offering new insights into the distribution and characteristics of kidney cancer BMs."

We hypothesized that the myocardial remodeling of ATTR-CM may be detectable through artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 12-lead electrocardiographic (ECG) images. Methods: Across 5 hospitals of a large U.S.-based hospital system, we identified patients with ATTR-CM, defined by the presence of a positive nuclear scan with an approved bone radiotracer or pharmacotherapy with an approved transthyretin stabilizer between 2015 and the first half of 2023. The development cohort consisted of 1,011 ECGs from 234 patients (age 79 [IQR:70-85] years, n=176 [17.4%] women), who were age- and sex-matched in a 10:1 ratio to 10,110 ECGs from 10,110 controls (age 79 [IQR:70-85] years, n=1,800 [17.7%] female). A convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained using a bio-contrastive pretext on ECGs before 2015 was fine-tuned for ATTR-CM using 5-fold cross-validation and subsequently tested in an independent set of cases (139 ECGs in 47 patients; age 80 [75-86] years, n=44 (31.7% women)) and matched controls (1390 ECGs and patients) from the second half of 2023.

Intersectional vulnerabilities among individuals with SCD in the United States (US) raise historically and socially contingent questions about tubal sterilization in individuals with SCD. However immediate postpartum tubal sterilization (TS) rates among individuals with SCD in the US are unknown. Objective: To compare rates of TS in deliveries to people with SCD and without SCD, and to determine the modifying effect of severe maternal morbidity (SMM) on the odds of TS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This repeated cross-sectional study used the 2012-2019 National Inpatient Sample to estimate the rate of TS among delivery hospitalizations to people with SCD, without SCD (non-SCD), Black people with and without SCD, and people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Logistic regression models estimated the odds of TS between SCD and non-SCD deliveries, SCD and non-SCD deliveries with Black race, and SCD and CF deliveries. We examined whether SMM modified the association between TS and SCD in interaction analyses. Exposure: SCD, CF Results: Among 29,822,518 deliveries, 6.7% underwent TS. Among 18,860 SCD deliveries, 8.8% underwent TS. Among 2,945 CF deliveries, 6.6% underwent TS. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, SCD had higher odds of TS compared to non-SCD deliveries (aOR= 1.38 [1.06,1.79]) and in a stratified analysis of deliveries coded with Black race (aOR= 1.42 [1.06,1.90]). After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, there was no difference in the odds of TS between SCD or CF deliveries (aOR=1.0 [0.51,2.24]). SMM more than doubled the odds of TS in SCD deliveries (interaction: aOR=2.34 [1.57,3.47]; aOR= 2.14 [1.40,3.24] in deliveries coded with Black race). Conclusion: Even after accounting for patient and hospital characteristics, people with SCD have higher odds of immediate postpartum TS compared to control groups. SMM at delivery increased the odds of TS in SCD compared to all non-SCD deliveries and compared to CF deliveries. Possibly SMM severity, patient preference, or clinician recommendations inform this finding. SMM is 3-7 times more common in SCD than non-SCD pregnancies and may be a modifiable risk factor for TS in SCD deliveries."

Methods: Functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) were acquired during two different modalities (the face and the scene) from a previously validated gradual-onset continuous (gradCPT) paradigm to evaluate sustained attention performances. In addition, we performed linear regression analyses to investigate how cerebral activation varied as a function of covariates of interest. Results: We showed a bilateral fronto-parieto-occipito brain activation during response inhibition regardless the type of task. Participants demonstrated better behavioral performances during the scene gradCPT. We observed a mainly left-lateralized pattern of activation in a fronto-cingulo-cerebellum area during the face gradCPT and an extended bilateral fronto-temporo-parieto-occipital activation during the scene gradCPT. Finally, we found associations between brain activity and behavioral attentional responses.

The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) discourages testing and treating ASB other than in pregnant women during routine obstetric visit screening and patients undergoing urologic procedures with expected mucosal bleeding. Unnecessary urinalysis (UA) and inappropriate antibiotic use persist in Emergency Departments (EDs). This study aims to evaluate UA testing and antibiotic treatment patterns for ASB in an urban ED, assessing adherence to IDSA guidelines and setting baseline rates for an educational intervention to align testing and treatment with IDSA guidelines. Methods We conducted a 15-month study to assess adherence to IDSA guidelines for proper UTI screenings and prescribing. We reviewed records of 50 adult patients who had a UA at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center ED to determine whether they met IDSA criteria for UA testing and appropriate antibiotic use. Patients with sepsis or other conditions requiring empiric antibiotics were excluded. We performed a univariate analysis to describe the population and factors associated with treating urinalysis findings. Statistical significance was set at p <0.05. Results Sixty-four percent of patients were asymptomatic and 36% were symptomatic. None of the asymptomatic patients met IDSA criteria for UA testing. Symptomatic patients were nearly-statistically more likely than asymptomatic patients to have a positive UA ( 72.2% vs. 43.8%, p = 0.06), and were more-often prescribed antibiotics for a positive UA (61.5% vs. 14.3%; p = 0.0128). They were also more-often prescribed antibiotics for a negative UA (20.0% vs. 0%; p = 0.05). Discussion The study findings revealed significant discordance between IDSA guidelines and current ED practices, with 64% of UA tests deemed unnecessary for ASB patients. These results align with previous studies highlighting the prevalence of over-testing with UAs and over-treatment of ASB. Unnecessary testing and inappropriate antibiotic treatment lead to increased costs and risks of antibiotic resistance, adverse drug events, and Clostridium difficile infection. This study highlights the necessity for planned educational initiatives to reduce unnecessary UAs and treatment and improve adherence to evidence-based guidelines."

Furthermore, AC lowered biochemical disease activity in our double-blind randomized trial in patients with ulcerative colitis. Here, we report on the changes in the faecal microbiome composition in the patient upon AC exposure in this trial. Methods: Ulcerative colitis patients received a 3g daily dose of an AC-rich bilberry extract (ACRE) for eight weeks. We determined the microbiome composition in longitudinal stool samples from 24 patients and quantified the degree of change over time. We also correlated the relative abundances of individual microbial taxa at different time points to faecal concentration measurements of calprotectin. Results: Microbiome compositions did not change over time as a result of the intervention, both in terms of alpha and beta diversity. Before the intervention, Haemophilus parainfluenzae was positively correlated with faecal calprotectin concentrations, and this correlation persisted in placebo-treated subjects throughout the study. In contrast, the correlation between H. parainfluenzae and the concentration of faecal calprotectin vanished in ACRE-treated subjects, while the relative abundance of H. parainfluenzaae did not change. Conclusion: Our results suggest that ACRE treatment mitigates the contribution of H. parainfluenzae to inflammation. Further research is warranted to better comprehend the role of microbial composition in response to medical therapy including AC-rich extract in ulcerative colitis patients."

In 2022 we re-surveyed nine Nairobi County neighbourhoods that were previously surveyed in 2015. We aimed to determine pulmonary TB prevalence, compare prevalence to 2015 estimates, and evaluate changes in risk groups. Participants who reported cough of any duration and/or whose chest x-ray suggested TB submitted sputum for smear microscopy, Xpert Ultra, and liquid culture. We defined prevalent TB as Mycobacterium tuberculosis detection by sputum Xpert or culture, excepting individuals who were only trace positive. Our methods differed from 2015, which used solid media, Xpert MTB/RIF, and cough duration >2 weeks. We calculated TB prevalence using random-effects logistic regression models with missing value imputations and inverse probability weighting.

Materials and Methods: The models were developed and evaluated using a retrospective dataset of patients who presented with acute ICH of unknown cause upon admission, using CT scans obtained from a single institution between January 2016 and May 2020 for both training and testing. Etiology of ICH were binarized into non-neoplastic and neoplastic ICH according to follow-up MRI results based on the ATOMIC ICH classification. Masks for ICH and PHE were manually segmented. Two separate models were trained: 1) An nnU-Net segmentation model 2) A ResNet-34 classification model. An end-to-end tool was evaluated by concatenating the two models which allowed the segmentation model to preprocess the images for the classification model. Performance enhancement was assessed by fine-tuning the model on a randomly selected, small subset of the external cohort. To assess the model's generalizability, the performance was additionally validated on an external dataset. Evaluation metrics were accuracy (Acc), area under the curve (AUC) and corresponding sensitivities and specificities. Results: A total of 291 patients were included of whom 116 (39.86%) presented with neoplastic and 175 (60.14%) with non- neoplastic ICH. The end-to-end classification tool achieved an Acc of 86% and an AUC of 85% with a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 93% in the test set. On the external validation cohort (n=58), the classification pipeline achieved an AUC of 68% and Acc of 66% (sensitivity 64%; specificity 67%). Fine-tuning on a selected small subset of the external cohort enhanced performance, achieving an AUC and accuracy of 70% (sensitivity 70%; specificity 71%). Conclusion: An end-to-end classification tool achieved a high diagnostic performance and generalizability in classifying neoplastic from non-neoplastic ICH on CT, suggesting a robust framework for a potential clinical implementation as a decision-aided tool in early ICH management."

PA may modulate the input and output stages of processing spatial cognitive information. However, the cortical plasticity mechanisms related to the behavioral effects of PA are poorly understood. Non-invasive sensorimotor electrical stimulation (Stim) may upregulate corticomotor excitability and is commonly used as a therapeutic adjunct during motor training. Objective: To evaluate the effects of combining PA with Stim on corticomotor excitability and visuo-spatial-motor behavior. Methods: We used a repeated-measures design to evaluate the effects of 1 session of PA with and without Stim in 15 young able-bodied individuals (18-35 years). Corticomotor output, intracortical inhibition, and facilitation were evaluated before and after PA with motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited from single and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) delivered to M1 hotspots of bilateral upper and left lower limbs. Results: Behaviorally, both PA+Stim and PA+Sham showed significant sensorimotor aftereffects (visuo-spatial and proprioceptive pointing). Neurophysiologically, suprathreshold MEP amplitude increased in the left first dorsal interossei, left tibialis anterior, and left soleus following the PA+Stim condition compared to the PA+Sham condition. Additionally, following PA+Stim, Short Interval Intra-Cortical Inhibition (SICI) increased in the left tibialis anterior and left soleus. Conclusion: Although both PA+Stim and PA+Sham had similar behavioral aftereffects, only PA+Stim increased cortical excitability in M1 representations of the left upper and lower limb (toward the direction of the PA aftereffect), suggesting that PA+Stim may elicit greater neurophysiological changes than PA alone.

Methods: A follow-up from a previous study exploring the social participation of adults with SCI living during the first wave was conducted eight months later (second wave). Social participation was measured using the Assessment of Life Habits (LIFE-H 4.0) and Measure of Quality of the Environment (MQE)) among 18 adults with SCI. Results: Participants reported increases between both waves of COVID-19 in life habits categories, including mobility, personal care and health, nutrition, and recreation. New environmental factors were identified as facilitators, including the increased availability of businesses in the community. Conclusion: These findings suggest that people with SCI increased fulfillment and satisfaction of certain life habits.

Early detection of silicosis is helpful for preventing disease progression, but existing diagnostic methods, including X-rays, CT scans, and spirometry, often detect the disease only at late stages. This study investigates a rapid, non-invasive diagnostic approach using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) to analyse volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath from 31 silicosis patients and 60 healthy controls. Six different interpretable machine learning (ML) models with Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were applied to classify these samples and determine VOC features that contribute the most significantly to model accuracy. The extreme gradient boosting (XGB) classifier demonstrated the best performance, achieving an area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.933 with the top ten SHAP features. The m/z 442 feature, potentially corresponding to leukotriene-E3, emerged as a significant predictor for silicosis. The VOC sampling and measurement process takes less than five minutes per sample, highlighting its potential suitability for large-scale population screening. Moreover, the ML models are interpretable through SHAP, providing insights into the features contributing to the model's predictions. This study suggests that APCI-MS breath analysis could enable early and non-invasive diagnosis of silicosis, helping to improve disease outcomes."

Methods: Instrumented Mouthguard (iMG) data were collected for 250 men and 132 women from 1,865 and 807 player-matches, respectively, and synchronised to video-coded match footage. Head peak resultant linear acceleration (PLA), peak resultant angular acceleration (PAA) and peak change in angular velocity (dPAV) were extracted from each head acceleration event (HAE). HAEs were linked to documented HIA1 events, with ten logistical regression models for men and women, using a random subset of non-case HAEs, calculated to identify kinematic variables associated with HIA1 events. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) were used to describe thresholds for HIA1 removal. Results: Increases in PLA, and dPAV were significantly associated with an increasing likelihood of HIA1 removal in the men's game, with an OR ranging from 1.05-1.12 and 1.13-1.18, respectively. The optimal values to maximise for both sensitivity and specificity for detecting an HIA1 were 1.96krad.s-2, 24.29g, and 14.75rad.s-1 for PAA, PLA, and dPAV respectively. Only one model had any significant variable associated with increasing the likelihood of a HIA1 removal in the women's game - PAA with an OR of 8.51 (1.23-58.66).

These biomarkers provide insights into consciousness levels, severity, and outcomes. This study aims to determine the potential of these biomarkers in predicting the mortality and neurological outcome of severe COVID-19 patients. Methods: We examined severe COVID-19 patients who required mechanical ventilation and observed them both during sedation and after sedation cessation. Standard EEG and ECG recordings were conducted at bedside, from which 5 minutes of continuous data were analyzed. Using a synthetic data generation model, we evaluated bidirectional brain-heart interactions from EEG power and heartbeat dynamics series. Results: Our findings indicate that brain-heart interactions, especially involving cardiac parasympathetic activity, can provide information about patients' severity. We observed correlations with acute encephalopathy duration (coma and delirium), particularly evident in top-down markers (from brain to heart) while bottom-up signaling (from heart to brain) correlated with ICU mortality. Additionally, we noted stronger modulation of brain-heart interactions in milder patients when comparing sedation versus non-sedation conditions, compared to those in more severe states. Conclusions: Our results imply that autonomic dysfunctions, as measured through brain-heart interactions, can track the pathophysiology of comatose states following COVID-19 infection. Significance: These findings highlight the potential of brain-heart interactions as an integrated marker for autonomic function in critical care, offering a more accurate assessment of patient severity and outcomes compared to isolated cardiac or brain measures."

A new cardiovascular disease diagnosis offers an opportunity to improve health outcomes through lifestyle changes. However, sustaining behavior change, even with effective exercise interventions, remains challenging. Understanding the neurobehavioral mechanisms behind successful long-term behavior change can help tailor therapeutic strategies to enhance physical activity and reduce dementia and stroke risks in older adults. This study followed 295 cognitively unimpaired older adults from the UK-Biobank cohort, all newly diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, over five years. We aimed to predict future changes in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) engagement using baseline resting-state functional connectivity, along with sociodemographic factors (e.g., age, sex, socioeconomic status), behavioral characteristics (e.g., general health, pain, depression), cognitive function (e.g., attention, fluid intelligence), social factors (e.g., networks and support), and environmental context (e.g., access to green spaces). Our findings revealed that greenspace percentage, social support, and retirement status significantly predicted increased MVPA at follow-up. A support vector machine (SVM) model, utilizing baseline functional connectivity matrices, achieved 84% accuracy in predicting successful MVPA engagement at follow-up. Key features contributing to the model's accuracy included functional connectivity between brain regions located in distinct large-scale networks, particularly the heteromodal cortex. Notably, the default mode network, frontoparietal control network, and salience/ventral attention network were prominently involved. These results underscore the importance of social and structural determinants of health, such as greenspace and social support, in promoting physical activity behavior change. Furthermore, they provide preliminary evidence of neural mechanisms that may underlie successful lifestyle modifications, informing future interventions to prevent vascular contributions to late-life cognitive decline."

The study employed a registered, randomized, sham-tDCS controlled, three-way blinded, cross-over trial and a mixed-factors design with eight arms [between-subjects: group (pwRMS, controls); tDCS-polarity (excitatory, inhibitory); within-subjects: stimulation (active-, sham-tDCS)]. Concurrently with tDCS, participants completed a computerized version of the Symbol-Digit-Modalities-Test (SDMT), the current gold standard for quantifying IPS impairment in pwRMS. Bayesian modeling with generalized linear mixed models provided strong evidence for polarity specific modulation of IPS by SPL-tDCS and a double-dissociation of stimulation response in pwRMS and controls. Healthy individuals showed the canonical pattern of significantly enhanced and reduced processing speed during excitatory or inhibitory tDCS. In pwRMS, a re-versed pattern was found and tDCS-response was predicted by baseline SDMT performance; i.e., more or less impaired patients benefited from inhibitory or excitatory tDCS, respectively. Our results provide direct causal evidence for SPL involvement in IPS in health and disease and suggest that the degree of IPS impairment in pwRMS reflects compensatory or dysfunctional neuroplastic processes that can be counteracted in a polarity specific way. Identified standardized transition scores for the effectiveness of excitatory or inhibitory tDCS will inform future individually-tailored stimulation protocols in pwRMS."

Prior studies established the potential for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to either premotor cortex (PMC) or primary somatosensory cortex (PSC) to modify symptoms. However, clinical effects have been modest with limited understanding of the neural mechanisms hindering therapeutic advancement of this promising approach. Objective: This study aimed to understand the motor network effects of rTMS in WC that correspond with behavioral efficacy. We hypothesized that behavioral efficacy is associated with modulation of cortical and subcortical regions of the motor network. Methods: In a double-blind, cross-over design, twelve WC participants underwent weekly 10 Hz rTMS in one of three conditions (Sham-TMS, PSC-TMS, PMC-TMS) while engaged in a writing task to activate dystonic movements and measure writing fluency. Brain connectivity was evaluated using task-based fMRI after each TMS session. Results: 10 Hz rTMS to PSC, but not PMC, significantly improved writing dysfluency. PSC-TMS also significantly weakened cortico-basal ganglia, cortico-cerebellum, and intra-cerebellum functional connectivity (FC), and strengthened striatal connectivity relative to Sham. Increased PSC BOLD activity was associated with reduced dysfluent writing behavior. Conclusions: 10 Hz rTMS to PSC improved writing dysfluency by redistributing motor network connectivity and strengthening somatosensory-parietal connectivity. A key signature for effective stimulation at PSC and improvement in writing dysfluency may be strengthening of intra-cortical connectivity between primary somatosensory and superior parietal cortices. These findings offer mechanistic hypotheses to advance the therapeutic application of TMS for dystonia."

Amid efforts to understand spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS), uncovering the role of the choroid in its etiology is challenged by the accuracy of image segmentation. The present study extends deep learning-based choroid quantification from optical coherence tomography (OCT) to the characterization of pulsatile and topological changes in the macular plane and investigates changes in response to prolonged microgravity exposure. Methods We analyzed OCT macular videos and volumes acquired from astronauts before, during and after long-duration spaceflight. Deep learning models were fine-tuned for choroid segmentation and combined with further image processing towards vascularity quantification. Statistical analysis was performed to determine changes in time-dependent and spatially averaged variables from preflight baseline for OCT data. Results For 13 astronauts with a mean age of 47 {+/-} 9 years, there were significant increases in choroid thickness (CT) and luminal area (LA) of 14 {+/-} 25 m (P = 0.01) and 0.11 {+/-} 0.2 mm2 (P = 0.009) and no significant change in choroid vascularity index (CVI) averaged over OCT macular video segments. There was no significant change in the amplitude of pulsatile CT fluctuation ({Delta}CT), but significant increases in both pulsatile LA ({Delta}LA) and CVI ({Delta}CVI) of 0.077 {+/-} 0.14 mm2 (P = 0.009) and 0.03 {+/-} 0.06 (P = 0.01), respectively. For a subgroup of 6 astronauts for which inflight imaging was available, choroid volume, luminal volume and CVI over the macular region all increased significantly during spaceflight with the greatest differences reached at 90 days following launch. Conclusions The findings show that localized choroid pulsatile changes occur following prolonged microgravity exposure. They suggest that the choroid vessels expand in a manner similar to the choroid layer across the macular region during spaceflight, accompanied by a relative increase in the space they occupy. The methods developed provide new tools and avenues for studying and establishing effective countermeasures to risks associated with long-duration spaceflight."

Here, we characterize a pleiotropic syndrome with prominent prenatal onset growth restriction and notable neurodevelopmental delay across 14 cases from 12 families. Through exome and genome sequencing, we identify three distinct homozygous loss-of-function FBXO22 variants segregating with the disease: p.(Arg53Serfs*13), p.(Pro3Leufs*3) and p.(Val240Alafs*6), all predicted to lead to premature translation termination due to frameshift effects. We confirm that patient-derived primary fibroblasts are bereft of FBXO22 and show increased levels of the known substrate histone H3K9 demethylase KDM4B. Accordingly, we delineate a unique epigenetic signature for this disease in peripheral blood. Altogether, we identify and demonstrate that FBXO22 deficiency leads to a pleiotropic syndrome in humans encompassing growth restriction and neurodevelopmental delay, the pathogenesis of which may be explained by broad chromatin alterations."

By its nature, this text is flexible and inconsistent, making it challenging to use for clinical trial matching, decision support, and predictive modeling. In this study, we develop and assess text normalization pipelines built using large-language models. Materials and Methods: Here, we evaluated four LLM-based normalization strategies: Zero-Shot Recall, Prompt Recall, Semantic Search, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and one baseline, TF-IDF based String Matching. We compared normalization performance across two datasets of condition terms mapped to SNOMED, one tailored to oncology, and one covering a wide range of medical conditions. Additionally, we benchmarked our models against the TAC 2017 drug label annotations, which normalizes terms to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Preferred Terms. Results: RAG, which effectively combines Prompt Recall and Semantic Search, was the most effective, accurately identifying the correct term 88.31% of the time for the domain-specific dataset and 79.97% for the broader dataset. Our model achieved a micro F1 score of 88.01 on task 4 of the TAC2017 conference, surpassing all other models without relying on the provided training data. Discussion: These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in medical text normalization. We find that retrieval-focused approaches overcome traditional LLM limitations for this task. Conclusion: Large language models combined with retrieval-augmented generation should be explored for text normalization of biomedical free text."

Pharmacologic sedation is a major risk factor for delirium, but some sedation is often necessary for the provision of safe care of mechanically ventilated patients. A simple, transparent model that predicts sedative-associated delirium in mechanically ventilated ICU patients could be used to guide decisions about personalized sedation. Research Question: Can the risk of sedative-associated delirium be estimated in mechanically-ventilated ICU patients? Study Design and Methods: Using the subset of patients in a previously-published ICU cohort who received mechanical ventilation, we performed backward stepwise logistic regression to derive a model predictive of sedative-associated delirium. We validated this model internally using hundredfold bootstrapping. We then validated this model externally in a separate prospective cohort of mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Results: 836 patients comprised the derivation cohort. Backwards stepwise regression produced a model with age, BMI, sepsis, SOFA, malignancy, COPD, stroke, sex, and doses of sedatives (opioids, propofol, and/or benzodiazepines) as predictors of sedative-associated delirium. The model had very good discriminative power, with an area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC) of 0.83. Internal validation via bootstrapping showed preserved discriminatory function with an AUROC of 0.81 and graphical evidence of good calibration. External validation in a separate set of 340 patients showed good discrimination, with AUROC of 0.70. Interpretation: Sedative-associated delirium during acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation can be predicted using a simple, transparent model, which can now be validated in a prospective study."

Pes measurement with an esophageal balloon catheter, the current clinical reference standard, needs complex calibrations and a multitude of factors influence its reliability. Solid-state pressure sensors might be able to overcome these limitations. Objectives: To evaluate the accuracy of a new solid-state Pes transducer (Pessolid). We hypothesized that measurements are non-inferior to those obtained with a properly calibrated balloon catheter (Pesbal). Methods: Absolute and relative solid-state sensor Pes measurements were compared to a reference pressure in a 5-day bench setup, and to simultaneously placed balloon catheters in 15 spontaneously breathing healthy volunteers and in 16 mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Bland-Altman analysis was performed with nonparametric bootstrapping to estimate bias and upper and lower limits of agreement (LoA). Results: Bench study: Solid-state pressure transducers had a positive bias (Psolid - Pref) of around 1 cmH2O for the absolute minimal and maximum pressures, and no bias for pressure swings. Healthy volunteers: the solid-state transducer revealed a bias (Pessolid - Pesbal) [upper LoA; lower LoA] of 1.58 [8.19; -5.03], -2.37 [3.96; -8.69] and 3.94 [11.09; -3.20] cmH2O for end-expiratory, end-inspiratory and delta Pes values, respectively. ICU patients: the solid-state transducer showed a bias (Pessolid-Pesbal) [upper LoA; lower LoA] during controlled / assisted ventilation of: -0.15 [1.39; -1.70] / -0.20 [5.02; -5.41], 0.32 [3.35; -2.72] / -0.54 [4.60; -5.68] and 0.47 [3.79; -2.85] / 0.35 [3.88; -3.18] cmH2O for end-expiratory, end-inspiratory and delta Pes values, respectively. LoA were <2cmH2O for static measurements on controlled ventilation. Conclusions: the novel solid-state pressure transducer showed good accuracy on the bench, in healthy volunteers and in ventilated ICU-patients.

A matched control cohort was generated from the All of Us Research Program and we evaluated changes in patients with PAH compared to matched controls. Results: Among 109 patients with baseline monitoring, average daily steps correlated with 6MWD (r=0.66, p < 0.001) and percent rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (r=0.26, p=0.016).

However, the modulators underlying this exacerbated pathobiology are ill-defined. Recent work has demonstrated that uremic toxins are associated with limb amputation in PAD and have pathological effects in both the limb muscle and vasculature. Herein, we utilize multiomics to identify novel modulators of disease pathobiology in patients with PAD and CKD. METHODS: A cross-sectional study enrolled four groups of participants: controls without PAD or CKD (n=28), patients with PAD only (n=46), patients with CKD only (n=31), and patients with both PAD and CKD (n=18). Both targeted (uremic toxins) and non-targeted metabolomics in plasma were performed using mass spectrometry. Calf muscle biopsies were used to measure histopathology, perform bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq), and assess mitochondrial function. Differential gene and metabolite analyses, as well as pathway and gene set enrichment analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients with both PAD and CKD exhibited significantly lower calf muscle strength and smaller muscle fiber areas compared to controls and those with only PAD. Compared to controls, mitochondrial function was impaired in CKD patients, with or without PAD, but not in PAD patients without CKD. Plasma metabolomics revealed substantial alterations in the metabolome of patients with CKD, with significant correlations observed between uremic toxins (e.g., kynurenine, indoxyl sulfate) and both muscle strength and mitochondrial function. RNA sequencing analyses identified downregulation of mitochondrial genes and pathways associated with protein translation in patients with both PAD and CKD. Single nucleus RNA sequencing further highlighted a mitochondrial deficiency in muscle fibers along with unique remodeling of fibro-adipogenic progenitor cells in patients with both PAD and CKD, with an increase in adipogenic cell populations. CONCLUSIONS: CKD significantly exacerbates ischemic muscle pathology in PAD, as evidenced by diminished muscle strength, reduced mitochondrial function, and altered transcriptome profiles. The correlation between uremic toxins and muscle dysfunction suggests that targeting these metabolites may offer therapeutic potential for improving muscle health in PAD patients with CKD."

The optimal screening strategy for early AF detection and its role in stroke prevention in different subpopulations are unknown. We developed a computational patient-level AF model able to simulate the dynamic occurrence of AF and AF-associated outcomes during the entire lifetime of a virtual patient cohort to elucidate the impact of AF screening in virtual randomized clinical trials (V-RCTs). Methods The Markov-like computer model has 7 clinical states (sinus rhythm, symptomatic/asymptomatic AF, each with/without previous stroke, and death). AF-related atrial remodeling was incorporated, which influenced the age-/sex-dependent transition probabilities between states. Model calibration/validation was performed by replicating a wide range of clinical studies. AF screening strategies and stroke rates in the presence of defined interventions were assessed in V-RCTs. Results The model simulates the entire lifetime of virtual patients with minute-level resolution and provides perfect information on the occurrence of AF episodes and clinical outcomes (stroke, death). It replicates numerous age/sex-specific episode- and population-level AF metrics, including AF incidence/prevalence, progression rates, burden, episode duration, and stroke/mortality incidence. The benefits of intermittent AF screening in V-RCTs were frequency- and duration- dependent, with systematic thrice-daily single-ECG recordings providing the highest detection rates (64.6% of AF patients being diagnosed before their symptom-based clinical diagnosis). Screening groups had comparable 5-year stroke rates and lower 25-year stroke rates than the control group. These differences were increased by more effective anticoagulation therapy, in patients with higher baseline stroke risk, or in patients with delayed clinical AF diagnosis. Conclusions We present a novel computational patient-level AF model consistent with a large body of real-world data, enabling for the first time the systematic assessment of AF-management strategies. Screening protocols with more frequent and longer monitoring have higher AF-detection rates, but stroke reduction in screening-detected individuals is highly dependent on patients' and healthcare-systems' characteristics. V-RCTs suggest that frequent AF screening with effective anticoagulation can reduce stroke incidence in patients with high likelihood of delayed AF diagnosis."

Current methods for assessing keloids in clinical settings rely heavily on subjective measures, which are prone to interrater variability. This study introduces a machine learning (ML) pipeline prototype, designed to automate the detection, measurement, and colour analysis of keloid scars. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), the pipeline segments keloid lesions from 2D images, applies fiducial markers for accurate size measurement, and utilizes K-Means clustering for colorimetry analysis. The CNN achieved a classification accuracy of 98% on a small test dataset. Segmentation was further refined using binary masks and contour-based detection. Colorimetry analysis revealed heterogeneity in pigmentation across keloid lesions, was varied by patient skin type, and tracked changes over time. The pipeline was validated on patients over a 5 and 6 month period, accurately detecting changes in keloid size and colour. While the algorithm was highly effective in most cases, challenges were noted in patients with nascent keloid or those with dark skin tones where the contrast between keloid and skin was insufficient for accurate segmentation. Additionally, early-stage keloid detection showed inconsistencies in defining lesion boundaries, particularly when keloids expanded rapidly. Despite these limitations, the ML pipeline presents a promising tool for objective keloid assessment, offering a practical, accessible, and accurate alternative to current clinical practices."

Methods: We retrospectively examined the medical records of patients with POPFC treated with EUS-TD using external drainage between October 2016 and July 2024. Technical success was defined as successful placement of the external drainage. Clinical success was defined as the disappearance of fluid collection on follow-up computed tomography without additional intervention. Results: This study included 14 patients. The median duration from surgery to endoscopic treatment was 13 (range: 11-26) days. The median procedural time was 26 (range: 13-35) min. The technical success rate was 100%, and 6 Fr endoscopic nasocystic drainage was performed in all patients. The clinical success rate was 64.3%, and no adverse events were observed. In 35.7% (5/14) of the patients, additional endoscopic internal drainage was required; the POPFC was successfully controlled in all patients. The reasons for conversion to internal drainage were prolonged inflammation in one patient, remaining fluid collection in one patient, and requests from surgeons in three patients. Conclusions: EUS-TD for POPFC with external drainage proved to be safe and effective, with a short procedure time. However, in certain patients, additional internal drainage is required."

A retrospective cohort analysis of 2144 patients who required emergency intervention for hypertension or had high blood pressure during other interventions. Effectiveness was based on blood pressure improvement post-intervention. 84.28% of interventions were performed by basic emergency teams, and 15.72% by specialist teams. Captopril and hydroxyzine were the most commonly used medications. Blood pressure improved in 36.61% of patients, with no improvement in 41.47%. Hydroxyzine was more frequently administered by paramedic teams, while captopril was favored by specialist teams. There were no statistically significant differences in captopril use across age groups, with approximately 80% receiving it. Hydroxyzine use did not vary significantly by age, though its overall use was low. Hydroxyzine showed a non-significant trend towards greater blood pressure reduction compared to captopril. Captopril is the primary treatment for acute hypertension in emergency settings, but hydroxyzine may have potential benefits, especially in patients with anxiety-related hypertension. However, due to the lack of significant evidence and current guidelines advising against hydroxyzine in elderly patients, further research is needed to establish protocols and optimize hypertension treatment strategies. Additionally, incorporating anxiolytics into guidelines and an official statement on their use would aid clinical practice."

However, for patients who fail anticoagulation or with severe symptoms, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has emerged as a treatment option. Objective: This study evaluates outcomes, complications, and comorbidities associated with EVT in patients with CVT. Methods: The 2015-2019 National Inpatient Sample (NIS) was queried for patients admitted to hospitals with ICD-10 diagnosis codes for CVT and procedure codes for EVT. Demographics, comorbidities, complications, and discharge dispositions were compared between patients undergoing EVT and medical management. Multivariate logistic regression determined independent predictors of outcomes, controlling for age, gender, cerebral edema/herniation, hemorrhage, mechanical ventilation, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, and National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) severity. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each complication/outcome. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) Statistical Software Version 29. Results: A total of 36,005 patients with CVT were identified. Of those, 325 (0.9%) underwent EVT. Patients who underwent EVT were older (49.28{+/-}19.08 years vs 43.62{+/-}23.29 years, p < 0.001), more likely to be female (61.5% vs. 54.8%, p = 0.016), and had higher rates of diabetes mellitus (18.5% vs. 13.5%, p = 0.012), hypertension (47.7% vs. 31.3%, p < 0.001), and obesity (13.8% vs. 8.1%, p < 0.001). They also had higher NIHSS scores (13.15 vs. 6.17, p < 0.001). EVT was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (15.4% vs. 4.6%, OR 1.627, p = 0.007) and lower routine discharge (29.2% vs. 57%, OR 0.599, p < 0.001). Conclusions: EVT patients had more severe conditions and higher mortality, potentially reflecting baseline severity rather than risks of EVT itself. Careful patient selection is crucial to improving outcomes in this population. Further studies are needed to refine patient selection criteria for EVT in CVT."

Methods: The cases of 22 patients with 22 fold-located CRCs (12 early CRCs and 10 advanced CRCs) who underwent a pretherapeutic computed tomographic colonography were retrospectively examined. T1-stage CRCs were classified into two categories according to the Japanese guideline: T1a-stage, carcinoma invading the superficial submucosa (< 1000 um); and T1b-stage, carcinoma invading the deeper submucosa ([&ge;] 1000 um). The maximum width of a lateral contour of the colorectal fold on which the CRC was located, i.e., the gap distance between the two adjacent haustrations, was calculated from the lateral split-view CT enema image by two gastrointestinal radiologists. These values were compared between the intramucosal / T1a CRCs and the T1b / more deeply invading CRCs. The inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficients were also evaluated for reliability. Results: The maximum widths of a lateral contour of the colorectal fold were significantly higher in the T1b / more deeply invading CRCs than in the intramucosal / T1a CRCs (p<0.0001). The optimum cut-off value of the maximum width of a lateral contour of the colorectal fold for differentiating the former from the latter was 6.0 mm, with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 100%, respectively. The inter-rater intraclass correlation coefficient for measurement of a lateral contour of the colorectal fold was 0.958. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time that quantitative evaluation of a width of lateral contour using a lateral split-view CT enema image can improve the diagnostic accuracy of the invasion depth for CRCs located on a colorectal fold."

However, factors such as household and neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) often covary with health differences between races, making it challenging to accurately reveal these differences using conventional covariate-control methods such as multiple regression. Alternative methods, such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM), may provide better covariate control. Supporting this notion, we found that PSM is more sensitive than regression-based methods in detecting health differences between self-reported Black and White children across a wide range of behavioral and neural measurements in the ABCD (5636 White, 1350 Black). Puberty status, an index of physical maturation, emerged as the largest difference between races and mediated the health differences between races on the majority of behavioral and neural variables. These findings highlight the importance of controlling for pubertal status and using more effective covariate-control methods to accurately represent health differences between Black and White children."

Consequently, this leads to slowing of nerve conduction, denervation, and reduced motor function. Slower neural conduction can negatively alter an individual's response time, which could increase the risk of falls. Further investigation is needed to determine the potential role exercise interventions may afford in mitigating age-related nerve deterioration. The purpose was two-fold: first, to determine the effects of resistance training on nerve conduction velocity (NCV), and second, to determine if changes in NCV are dependent on age. We hypothesized that training would result in faster nerves in both young and older adults, albeit to a lesser extent in older adults. Forty-eight subjects (18-84 yrs) completed this study (n = 26 younger, 22 older). Motor NCV and maximal strength were recorded before and after 4-weeks of handgrip training in both limbs. Training was conducted 3x/week with the use of a grip training kit. Mixed-factorial ANOVAs revealed significant increases in NCV for both the young (p < 0.001) and older training groups (p < 0.001), but neither control groups (p > 0.05). The young training group showed increased handgrip strength after four weeks (p = 0.004), while the other groups did not. The results of this study suggest that resistance training may be a viable method to counteract age-related nerve deterioration. These outcomes have the potential to improve quality of life and generate greater independence for our older populations."

We report the subgroup analyses. Patients and Methods: We randomized 1278 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive 2 years of placebo or everolimus, added to endocrine therapy for up to 4 years after initiation. Randomization was stratified by endocrine therapy agent, prior adjuvant versus neoadjuvant therapy, progesterone receptor expression, and lymph node involvement. Subgroup analyses by each stratification factor were prespecified. Post hoc analyses were performed according to menopausal status and age. We also analyzed treatment adherence. Results: We observed a limited trend toward more favorable prognostic features in tamoxifen-treated patients, with more frequent ER+/PR+ tumors (88.5% vs. 84.1%, p=0.026) and less frequent pN2+ status (39.8% vs. 46%, p=0.032). In premenopausal women, we observed a numerical benefit of everolimus: 3y-DFS was 86% in the placebo group and 90% in the everolimus group [HR=0.76 (95%CI: 0.43-1.34)]. In premenopausal patients treated with tamoxifen (n=153; 12.3%), we observed an even stronger trend in favor of everolimus as 3-year DFS was 84% in the placebo group and 91% in the everolimus group [HR=0.54 (95%CI: 0.28-1.02)]. Early discontinuation of either everolimus or placebo was less frequent in the tamoxifen group than in the AI group: 48.0% vs. 56.9% (p=0.028). Conclusions: The present post-hoc analyses generate hypotheses regarding the interaction between menopausal status, tamoxifen and everolimus in patients with high-risk, ER-positive, HER2-negative early breast cancer. They suggest that tamoxifen alone is no longer the standard of care in high-risk premenopausal patients."

Golgi integral membrane protein 4 (GOLIM4) is a member of transporter complex which is located to the cis/medial of Golgi, and its role in tumor is unknown. In this study we aimed to assess the expression of Golim4 (GPP130) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. Methods: The expression levels of Golim4 in 58 malignant EOC specimens and 11 benign and normal control tissues were determined by real-time RT-PCR. Clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. Non-parametric survival analysis was estimated by using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test. Parametric survival analysis was evaluated through multivariate Cox regression analysis and generalized Gamma survival model. Result: Our findings showed that Golim4 was significantly down-regulated in Serous Papillary type of EOC tissue specimens than in non-cancerous tissues (P<0.001); however; the expression of Golim4 in total EOC tissue specimens revealed non-significant up-regulation. Kaplan- Meier analysis and log-rank test have suggested that EOC patients with low Golim4 expression have shorter overall survival when compared with patients with other expression groups (log-rank test P<0.05). Semi-parametric Cox proportional hazards model indicated that the status of Golim4 were independent predictor of overall survival in patients with EOC. Correlation analysis has been done by Spearman Rank correlation coefficient."

Nevertheless, the use of EHRs in research poses challenges. EHRs, although originally created to document patient encounters, are now primarily used to satisfy billing requirements. As a result, EHR data may lack granularity, potentially leading to misclassification and incomplete representation of patient conditions.

HIV stigma shapes both individual behaviour and community responses to HIV. However, modelling approaches have rarely represented the complex role of stigma in HIV epidemics. Our study introduces an innovative modelling framework designed to capture the interplay between stigma and HIV transmission dynamics. Methods We modelled effects of anticipated, internalised, and experienced HIV stigma on HIV testing, antiretroviral treatment initiation, and treatment adherence. We built an individual-based model representing the HIV epidemic (HIV-IBM) in a USA-like population of 3 million individuals that accounts for community demography, behaviour, and healthcare access. Stigma parameters were based on a scoping review focused on the prevalence and effects of stigma in people living with and without HIV. HIV-IBM was used to assess effects of interventions targeting different types of stigma. We tested reductions of stigma by 50% and 100% across the simulated population and performed a sensitivity analysis to identify effects of each type of stigma on the simulated HIV epidemic. Results Without reduced stigma, the HIV-IBM had an annual incidence rate of 12.6 (95% credible interval [CI]: 11.4-13.5) new cases per 100,000 people. Reducing the overall level of stigma in the population by 50% resulted in an annual incidence rate of 9.6 (95% CI: 8.6-10.3) per 100,000, and a 100% reduction in stigma resulted in an annual incidence rate of just 6.8 (95% CI: 6.1-7.3) per 100,000. In addition to reducing HIV incidence, reducing stigma resulted in a substantial increase of viral suppression among people living with HIV (50% stigma reduction: +10.5%; 100% stigma reduction: +16.4%). Sensitivity analysis showed that outcomes resulting from interventions targeting each type of stigma were highly heterogeneous. Conclusion Simulation results suggest that reducing HIV stigma could have a large effect on HIV incidence and viral suppression. Our model framework provides a dynamic approach to understanding the role of stigma in HIV outcomes that facilitates exploration of stigma reduction strategies and offers insights to inform evidence-based policies and interventions for reducing stigma and curtailing HIV."

However, neighborhood exposures shift as communities undergo gentrification, a pattern of neighborhood change defined by increasing affluence (in wealth, education, and housing costs). Gentrification has inconsistent associations with infant health outcomes like IM, which may be due to differing relationships between its composite measures and such outcomes. We designed a retrospective cohort analysis of all births and deaths from 2010-2019 across 4 metropolitan areas in Michigan to determine how gentrification and its neighborhood-change components are associated with risk of IM, using multilevel multivariable logistic regression models. Among 672,432 infants, 0.52% died before 1 year. IM was not associated with gentrification. Census tracts with greater increases in income and education had lower rates of IM, but tracts with greater increases in rent costs had higher rates of IM. In unadjusted models, odds of IM were 40% and 15% lower for infants living in tracts in the top quartile increase in household income and college completion, respectively, compared to infants from tracts with the least amount of change. Odds of IM were also increased 29% in infants from tracts with the most increases in rent, though these differences were attenuated when adjusting for individual social factors. Indicators of increasing community affluence have opposing relationships with IM. Policies and interventions that address rising housing costs may reduce IM."

This study examines the phenomenon of bioaccumulation in relation to up to six distinct biological and biomedical parameters pertaining to vascular structure and composition in three organ tissues: the brain cortex, kidney, and liver. As anticipated based on fundamental mechanistic considerations of bioaccumulation (washing rate), the MNP content appears to be proportional to the inverse of the capillary volume fraction ($V_c$), exhibiting no correlation with any other geometric variable, such as capillary diameter or capillary segment length. This finding is consistent with the small size spectra of MNPs in comparison to these dimensions. However, contrary to expectations, no correlation was observed between MNP content and biological composition (lipid, water, or carbohydrate content), while a likely non-causal correlation was observed between MNP content and protein content, which may be simply attributed to the non-linear correlation between protein content and $V_c$. The conclusions that point to a possibly exceedingly large number of MNP particles currently in our brains call for urgent further investigation and the revision of the published data."

Methods Two broad reviews were designed: a systematic review structured according to the PRISMA guideline with abstract inclusion based on PICO criteria; and a scoping review, where we defined abstract characteristics and features of interest to look for. For both reviews 500 abstracts were sampled. Two readers independently screened abstracts with disagreements handled with arbitrations or consensus, which served as the reference standard. The abstracts were analysed by six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4T, GPT-3.5, Claude3-Opus, Claude3-Sonnet, and Claude3-Haiku). Primary outcomes were diagnostic test accuracy measures for abstract inclusion, abstract characterisation and feature of interest detection. Secondary outcome was the degree of automation using LLMs as a function of the error rate. Results In the systematic review 12 studies were marked as include by the human consensus. GPT-4o, GPT-4T, and Claude3-Opus achieved the highest accuracies (97% to 98%) comparable to the human readers (96% and 98%), although sensitivity was low (33% to 50%). In the scoping review 130 features of interest were present and the LLMs achieved sensitivities between 74-84%, comparable to the human readers (73% and 86%). The specificity of GPT-4o (98%) and GPT-4T (>99%) greatly surpassed the other LLMs (between 33% and 93%). For abstract characterization all LLMs achieved above 95% accuracy for language, manuscript type and study participant characterisation. For characterisation of disease-specific features only GPT-4T and GPT-4o showed very high accuracy. For abstract inclusion the highest automation rate (91%) at the lowest error rate (8%) was achieved by use of two LLMs with disagreement solved by human arbitration. An LLM pre screening before human abstract screening achieved an automation rate of 55% with no missed abstracts. Conclusion Abstract characterisation and specific feature of interest detection with LLMs is feasible and accurate with GPT-4o and GPT-4T. The majority of abstract screenings for systematic reviews can be automated with use of LLMs, at low error rates."

However, effective simulation methods are limited. Current, commercial, and homemade phantoms lack replication of anatomical correctness and texture complexity of brain and tumour tissue in ultrasound images. Materials and Methods: We utilise ex-vivo brain tissue, as opposed to synthetic materials, to achieve realistic echogenic complexity and anatomical correctness. Agar, at 10-20\% concentrate, is injected into the brain tissue to simulate the tumour mass. A commercially available phantom was purchased for benchmarking. Results: Qualitative analysis is performed by experienced professionals, measuring the impact of the addition of agar and comparing it to the commercial phantom. Overall, the use of ex vivo tissue was deemed more accurate and representative, compared to the synthetic materials-based phantom, as it provided good visualisation of real brain anatomy and good contrast within tissue. The agar tumour correctly produced a region of higher echogenicity with slight diffusion along the margin and expected interaction with the neighbouring anatomy. Discussion: Using human samples for training is limited due to high logistical and ethical challenges. Sparsity of online neurosurgical US data further compounds this. The proposed method successfully produced a better simulation of tumours in brain tissue than the phantom which suffers from surface texture dissimilarity, ultrasound echogenic homogeneity, and lack of anatomical correctness. Conclusion: The proposed method for creating tumour-mimicking tissue in brain tissue is inexpensive, accurate, and simple. Beneficial for both the trainee clinician and the researcher.

A revised version of this test, termed the UPSIT-R, was developed in 2020 to update certain odorants and response options. The goal of this study was to establish normative age- and sex-specific data for the UPSIT-R in a large adult cohort and to compare the resultant percentiles to those of the original UPSIT. A second study was performed to compare the relative performance of these two tests in a small cohort of persons with and without Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods UPSIT-R percentiles were derived separately by age (60-64, 65-69, 70-74, 75-59, and [&ge;]80 years) and sex (male, female) categories in 16,972 volunteers who were predominantly white and non-Hispanic. Percentiles were derived statistically using an empirical distribution averaging procedure. A Bland-Altman plot was employed to visualize the level of agreement between percentiles for the UPSIT-R and UPSIT. For the second study, non-parametric statistics were employed to compare the results of those with and without PD. Results UPSIT-R performance declined with increasing age; deficits were more pronounced in men than in women. The magnitude of the difference between the original and revised test percentile scores differed by age and sex; women had up to a 3-point improvement with the UPSIT-R whereas the oldest male age had up to a 3-point decline in percentile scores. Olfactory deficits in PD were confirmed on the UPSIT-R. Discussion This study provides normative data clinically useful for assessing the relative degree of dysfunction in persons 60 years of age and older using the UPSIT-R. Like the traditional version of the UPSIT, this version demonstrates that smell function declines with age and is generally better in women than in men, providing a solid clinical basis for physicians to accurately determine the degree of smell dysfunction in their patients."

Patients were recruited between 2012 and 2017 at 73 centres in seven countries. In the intention-to-treat analysis (n=6644), there was no significant difference in one year mortality between patients randomised to surgery under deep (target BIS 35) or light anaesthesia (target BIS 50). However the separation between randomised groups was only 8.4 BIS units and the trial was criticised for being underpowered. Methods In a secondary analysis of this trial's data, we made alternative per-protocol estimates designed to improve the power of the trial. We added an additional covariate - each patient's deviation from target BIS - to the original analysis, statistically recreating the desired separation of 15 BIS units between randomised groups. We used multiple imputation to recover missing BIS values. We also assessed whether a proportional hazards Cox model was appropriate for the analysis of one year mortality. Results Our alternative per-protocol estimates did not differ materially from the original per-protocol estimate. The gain in precision through using all intent-to-treat patients for our per-protocol estimates was offset by the additional variance introduced when modelling missing BIS values. When modelling missing BIS, we found regional differences: in China, the separation between randomised groups was far higher (13.6 BIS units) than in any other region. Estimates and plots assessing proportional hazards suggested increasing late mortality under deep anaesthesia, most notably in China. Conclusion Our hypothesis is that deep anaesthesia in the Balance trial led to higher postoperative delirium, which in turn led to an increase in late mortality. In future trials, patients should be followed for more than a year and cause of death recorded."

Plaque erosion, a significant contributor to acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), is linked to fibrous plaques and is more prevalent in women as compared to men. We hypothesize that the molecular drivers of histologically determined fibrous plaques differ between men and women. Methods: Human end-stage atherosclerotic plaques were isolated from consecutive patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy and were included in the Athero-Express biobank. Fibrous plaques from both female and male patients were histologically assessed and further processed to obtain protein, bulk RNA, single-cell RNA and DNA methylation data. We leveraged sex-differential expression and deconvolution analyses to uncover sex-biased molecular mechanisms and cellular dynamics which were experimentally validated using an EndMT in vitro model. Results: Out of 1,889 atherosclerotic plaques (1,309 male and 580 female), fibrous lesions were observed in 50% of female (n=290) and 31% of male patients (n=416). Compared to patients with atheromatous plaques (n=494), women with fibrous plaques exhibited a higher prevalence of smoking (41% vs. 33%), while men with fibrous plaques presented more often with diabetes (29% vs. 20%). Transcriptional and proteomic phenotyping highlighted more immune-dependent and inflammatory processes in male fibrous plaques. Genes and proteins with higher abundance in female fibrous plaques pointed to endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) and extracellular matrix remodelling. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified a dominant role of endothelial and smooth muscle cells in female plaques, and more macrophages in males. Finally, at the cellular level, we show that sex -specific, smoking-mediated promoter methylation changes may explain these differences. Conclusions: Patients with end-stage fibrous atherosclerotic plaques have a distinct clinical profile, with men more often having diabetes and women more often smoking. This clinical profile associates with sex differences that point to different cellular and molecular compositions of fibrous plaques. These mechanisms might be candidate pathways to understand plaque erosion from a molecular point of view and may provide promising targets for atherosclerosis therapies, as they account for the sex-specific differences in plaque phenotype."

Kiefte-de Jong']",Jesper Mulder (j.mulder6@lumc.nl),['Leiden University Medical Center'],"Background Interoception, the perception of the internal state of the body, offers an underrepresented and intriguing potential avenue for altering lifestyle-related behaviors. Interoception is intrinsically related to maintaining homeostasis and the flexible allostatic regulation of complex demands. Internal bodily states may also be influenced by lifestyle factors and related problems. This systematic review aimed to provide insight into the current state of evidence about the role of interoception in lifestyle factors. Methods Studies from three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) were screened for eligibility based on two inclusion criteria: 1) at least one measure of interoception (e.g., interoceptive accuracy, attention, or awareness), and 2) at least one measure of a lifestyle factor (i.e., alcohol consumption, cognitive leisure and relaxation activities, eating behavior, exercise, sleep, or smoking). Risk of bias was assessed using an adjusted quality score checklist, consisting of five items related to study design, population size, exposure measurement, outcome measurement, and adjustment for confounders. Results The review included 73 studies. Out of the included studies, 51 measured interoceptive accuracy and 36 measured interoceptive attention. Six studies quantified interoceptive awareness. In terms of lifestyle factors, 26 studies on cognitive leisure and relaxation activities, 19 studies on eating behavior, 12 studies focused on alcohol consumption, 10 studies on exercise, five studies on smoking, and four studies on sleep were identified. Findings show positive relations between interoception and cognitive leisure and relaxation activities, eating behavior, and exercise. Conversely, the consumption of alcohol is negatively related to interoception. Studies in the smoking and sleep lifestyle factors were sparse and of varying methodological quality. Discussion The findings of this review show that interoceptive domains are associated with various lifestyle factors, but the quality of the evidence is limited. Future longitudinal studies with more objective measures of interoception are needed in order to better understand the interrelations between interoception and lifestyle factors."

The SLC19A1 gene, encoding the reduced folate carrier, is critical for folate metabolism, essential for DNA synthesis during embryogenesis. The G80A polymorphism in SLC19A1 may influence folate transport efficiency and contribute to CHD risk. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the association between SLC19A1 G80A polymorphism and CHD susceptibility. A systematic review of major databases, including PubMed and EMBASE, was conducted to identify relevant case-control studies. Genetic risk models, such as allele (A vs G), heterozygous (GA vs GG), homozygous (AA vs GG), dominant (GA + AA vs GG), and recessive (AA vs GG + GA), were analyzed using RevMan 5.4.1, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) calculated. Initial results across most genetic models did not show a significant association between G80A polymorphism and CHD. However, after excluding outliers, a moderate association was observed between the GA genotype and increased CHD risk (OR: 1.34, CI: 1.07, 1.66). These findings suggest a minimal genetic effect, warranting further research in diverse populations."

Tijms', 'Lianne M. Reus']",Lianne M. Reus (l.reus@amsterdamumc.nl),"['Amsterdam UMC, location VUmc']","Objective: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with a considerable genetic contribution that remains not fully understood. The hippocampus plays a critical role in learning and memory, with its volume loss being a core hallmark of AD. Hippocampal volume also has a strong heritable component and its genetic underpinnings may help us to understand the complex biological mechanism underlying AD. Methods: We performed cross-trait analysis of exisiting GWAS data on late-onset AD and Hippocampal volumes using the conjunctional false discovery rate (conjFDR) framework to identify the specific shared genetic basis.For identified SNPs, we performed functional annotation and phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). Results: Our cross-trait analyses identified 11 non-APOE lead genetic loci, of which 7 loci showed discordant directional effects (loci associated with decreased risk for AD and smaller hippocampal volumes, and vice versa). We found that SHARPIN and TNIP1 genes play a role in AD by affecting the hippocampal volumes. In addition, we observed 9 novel AD-hippocampus loci in genes previously implicated in AD (IGIP and ACE) and novel AD-genes (KCTD13, HINT1, SH3TC2, FAM53B, TPM1, IL34 and SSH2). Phenome-wide association study highlighted varying degrees of pleiotropy, including brain imaging measurements, white blood cell markers, red blood cell markers, and lipids in multiple shared loci. Conclusions: Our integrating GWAS study reveals a shared genetic basis between AD and hippocampal volumes. By integrating GWAS summary statistics for these two traits, we identified both novel and previously reported AD-hippocampus loci. Functional analysis highlights the roles of immune cells and lipid markers in the shared loci and traits, suggesting a shared neurobiological basis for both traits."

Proposed mechanisms include anti-inflammatory signalling mediated by SCFA-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), particularly GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109a, as suggested by knockout mouse models. We aimed to determine if rare pathogenic variants (RPVs) affecting GPCR genes in humans increase the risk of hypertension (HTN) and major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, and ischemic stroke. Methods: Using UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing data from 393,649 European participants, we identified rare (minor allele frequency <1%) pathogenic variants with predicted high-impact functional consequences in GPCR genes, based on Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor annotations. For missense variants, pathogenicity likelihood scores from AlphaMissense, Mendelian Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity, and Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, genetic ancestry, and other potential confounders, were conducted to compare RPV prevalence between cases and controls. Results: We identified a total of 158 RPVs in SCFA-sensing GPCR genes. The prevalence of RPV carriers was significantly higher in patients with HTN (OR=1.12, P=0.014) and MACEs (OR=1.18, P=0.009) than controls. In single GPCR gene analyses, RPVs in the FFAR2 gene (encoding GPR43) were associated with an increased risk of HTN (OR=1.23, P=0.005). RPVs in the HCAR2 gene (encoding GPR109A) were associated with a markedly increased risk of heart failure (OR=1.57, P=0.012). Conclusions: These findings confirm and extend previous results from knockout animal models in a large population-based cohort, highlighting the potential of GPCRs as therapeutic targets for HTN and cardiovascular diseases in humans."
