We describe this burden and compare it to the burden of influenza in the first two post-pandemic years in Denmark.  MethodsA cohort study including residents in Denmark from May 16, 2022, to June 7, 2024. Data were obtained from national registries, including information on Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test-positive COVID-19 and influenza admissions, mortality within 30 days of admission, sex, age, COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, comorbidity, and living in long-term care facility for elderly. Negative binomial regression was used to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRRs) to compare rates of admissions between COVID-19 and influenza. To assess severity of COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) of 30-day mortality between COVID-19 and influenza.  ResultsAmong 5,899,170 individuals, admissions with COVID-19 (n=24,687) were more frequent than admissions with influenza (n=8,682; aIRR 2.01, 95%CI 1.37-2.95), in particular during the first year (p=0.01), in the summer (p<0.001) and among people above 65 years of age (p<0.001). The number of deaths were also higher (COVID-19, n=2,393; influenza, n=522). Among patients, the risk of mortality of COVID-19 was higher than influenza in the 12-30 days following admission (0-11 days, aHR 1.08, 95%CI 0.94-1.25; 12-30 days, aHR 1.50, 95%CI 1.21-1.84), in particular among non-vaccinated for both COVID-19 and influenza (aHR 1.81, 95%CI 1.25-2.62), while it was similar to influenza among patients without comorbidities (aHR 1.07, 95%CI 0.63-1.80).  ConclusionCOVID-19 represented a greater disease burden than influenza, with more hospitalisations and deaths, and more severe disease primarily among non-vaccinated and comorbid patients. These results highlight the continued need for attention and public health efforts to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2."

The dataset, with 1021 cases and 10185 controls consisted of demographic variables and short-term informa-tion, on the subjects prior diagnosis and healthcare utilization. We examined the efficacy of the super learner ensemble method in predicting suicide-related death lever-aging its capability to combine multiple predictive algorithms without the necessity of pre-selecting a single model. The study compared the performance of the super learner against five base models, demonstrating its superiority in terms of cross-validated neg-ative log-likelihood scores. The super learner improved upon the best algorithm by 60% and the worst algorithm by 97.5%. We also compared the cross-validated AUCs of the models optimized to have the best AUC to highlight the importance of the choice of risk function. The results highlight the potential of the super learner in complex predictive tasks in medical research, although considerations of computational expense and model complexity must be carefully managed."

METHODSIn the FinnTwin16 cohort, 3,431 twins (47% men) reported smoking status, LTPA, and WC in early adulthood and 10 years later. Regression models were conducted to investigate associations of smoking status and of LTPA change (metabolic equivalent tasks [MET]-h/week) with WC change (cm) during the follow-up. Within-pair associations were analyzed using linear mixed fixed-effect regression among 800 same-sexed (409 identical) pairs.  RESULTSDuring the 10-year follow-up, 40% (n=454) quit smoking. Among those who quit smoking, the mean WC increase was 7.4 cm (SD 8.2) and the mean LTPA decrease was -0.02 MET-h/week (SD 35.8). Compared to individuals continuing daily smoking, only quitters who smoked daily at baseline ({beta} 1.87; 95% CI 0.68, 3.06) increased their WC. This association was not robust after shared familial influences were controlled for. Each additional MET-h/week lowered the risk for WC increase among individuals who smoked occasionally ({beta} -0.054; -0,08, -0.003), quitters who smoked daily ({beta} -0.05; -0.06, -0.02) and those who had never smoked ({beta} -0.04; -0.05, -0.03). In the analyses among identical twin pairs, LTPA was associated with less WC increase among those who quit occasional smoking or had never smoked. For quitters from daily smoking, this association approached significance, but no association remained for those continuing smoking.  CONCLUSIONSSmoking cessation seems to be associated with WC increase, but familial confounding is involved in this process. LTPA may inhibit post-cessation WC increase.  KEY MESSAGESThis will be published as a summary box after the abstract in the final published article.  What is already known on this topic1. Individuals quitting smoking tend to gain weight, but less is known of post-cessation abdominal obesity and the role of leisure-time physical activity in this process.   What this study adds2. Smoking cessation associates with moderate increase in waist circumference among those who quit daily smoking, but shared familial influences are involved in this process. 3. Increase in leisure-time physical activity may prevent post-cessation waist circumference increase.   How this study might affect research, practice, or policy4. More research is needed to unravel genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying post-cessation waist circumference increase. 5. In practice, individuals who quit smoking should be encouraged to be physically active."

According to the World Health Organizations (WHO) World Malaria Report 2023, there were approximately 249 million reported malaria cases in 2022 across 85 endemic countries, resulting in over half a million deaths. Progress towards global malaria eradication through antimalarial drugs has been slow, with case numbers increasing since 2015. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA), artesunate, and artemether, derivatives of artemisinin, are crucial components of modern antimalarial treatment. However, resistance to these drugs and their partners in Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) has emerged in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. In 2021, the WHO recommended widespread use of the RTS,S malaria vaccine among children in endemic regions. To address these challenges, we develop an extended SEIR age-structured model incorporating malaria vaccination for children, drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, and interactions between human hosts and mosquitoes. Our research focuses on evaluating how malaria vaccination coverage influences disease prevalence and transmission dynamics. We derive the basic, intervention, and invasion reproduction numbers for both strains and conduct sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters affecting infection prevalence. Our findings reveal that model outcomes are primarily influenced by scale factors that reduce transmission and natural recovery rates for the resistant strain, as well as by drug treatment and vaccination efficacies, and mosquito death rates. Numerical simulations indicate that while treatment reduces the malaria disease burden, it also increases the proportion of drug-resistant cases. Conversely, higher vaccination efficacy correlates with lower infection cases for both strains. These results suggest that a synergistic approach, involving both vaccination and treatment, could effectively decrease the overall proportion of the population that is infected."

Antimalarial medications differ in their efficacy in clearing the transmission stages of Plasmodium falciparum (gametocytes) and in preventing mosquito infection. Here we present a combined analysis of six trials conducted at the same study site with highly consistent methodologies that allows for a direct comparison of the gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities of fifteen different antimalarial regimens or dosing schedules. Methods and findings Between January 2013 and January 2023, six clinical trials with transmission endpoints were conducted at the Clinical Research Centre of the Malaria Research and Training Centre of the University of Bamako in Mali. These trials tested Artemisinin-Combination Therapies (ACTs), non-ACT regimens and combinations with 8-aminoquinolines. Participants were males and non-pregnant females, between 5-50 years of age, who presented with P. falciparum mono-infection and gametocyte carriage by microscopy. Blood samples were taken before and after treatment for thick film microscopy, infectivity assessments by mosquito feeding assays and molecular quantification of gametocytes. Mixed-effects generalized linear models were fit with individual-specific random effects and fixed effects for time points, treatment groups and their interaction. Models quantified changes in mosquito infection rates and gametocyte densities within treatment arms over time and between treatments. In a pooled analysis of 422 participants, we observed substantial differences between ACTs in gametocytocidal and transmission-blocking activities, with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) being significantly more potent at reducing mosquito infection rates within 48 hours than dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and pyronaridine-artesunate (PY-AS) (p<0.0001). The addition of single low dose primaquine (SLD PQ) accelerated gametocyte clearance and led to a significantly greater reduction in mosquito infection rate within 48-hours of treatment for each ACT, while an SLD of the 8-aminoaquinoline tafenoquine (TQ) showed a delayed but effective response compared to SLD primaquine. Finally, our findings confirmed considerably higher post-treatment transmission after sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine (SP-AQ) compared to most ACTs, with a significantly lower relative reduction in mosquito infection rate at day 7 compared to DHA-PPQ, AS-AQ, and AL (p<0.0001). Therefore, adding an SLD PQ to SP-AQ may be beneficial to block malaria transmission in community treatment campaigns. Conclusions We found marked differences among ACTs and single low-dose 8-aminoquinoline drugs in their ability and speed to block transmission. The findings from this analysis can support treatment policy decisions for malaria elimination and be integrated into mathematical models to improve the accuracy of predictions regarding community transmission and the spread of drug resistance under varying treatment guidelines."

The incidence of LTBI among the HCWs has seldom been investigated. Primary health centres (PHCs) provide effective and affordable medical care largely for the local population. The HCWs of PHCs who are likely to have increased occupational exposure have an increased risk of reactive as well as LTBI, and contribute to overall TB transmission than the general population. Methods A cross-sectional study (March-April 2024) was carried out to assess the burden of LTBI among the HCWs of PHCs (n=64) across Chennai, India. Blood samples were analyzed for gamma interferon using a QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus assay. A complete baseline health profile, including complete blood count, blood glucose, liver and renal functions, and ferritin levels was estimated to identify potential biomarkers that are independently associated with LTBI. Results The present study revealed an LTBI prevalence of 25.3% (n=99) among PHC workers. The red cell distribution width was significantly associated with LTBI positivity among different biochemical and haematological parameters analyzed. Factors such as individuals age, underlying comorbid conditions (30.3%; n=30), and longer employment duration (28%; n=28) were significantly associated with IGRA positivity. IGRA positivity was significantly associated with decreased RDW-SD in females, overweight, and participants with O blood group. Conclusions The study reported a high prevalence of LTBI among HCWs of PHCs, which necessitates their periodical screening for the elimination of TB."

Family planning counseling, when engaging with maternal healthcare services, may enhance modern contraceptive uptake in the postpartum period. However, evidence in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has yielded conflicting findings. We aimed to explore the effects of family planning counseling delivered as part of maternal healthcare on postpartum modern contraceptive uptake in LMICs. Methods: The following six databases were searched in April 2024: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Global Health, Medline, and Scopus. Studies that examined the association between family planning counseling and modern contraception uptake in the postpartum period were included. The findings of the included studies were summarized narratively and through a random-effects meta-analysis when data supported. Trim and fill estimates and subgroup analyses were conducted to address publication bias and heterogeneity, respectively. Results: A total of 61 studies were included, of which 42 studies were considered for quantitative synthesis and the remaining 19 studies included in a narrative synthesis. We found that women who received family planning counseling during maternal healthcare visits were 2.75 times (95% CI, 2.11-3.58) more likely to use modern contraception during the postpartum period compared to those who did not receive family planning counseling. Although we observed significant publication bias and heterogeneity, addressing these issues through trim and fill estimation and subgroup analyses, respectively, produced estimates consistent with the summary findings. A narrative synthesis of an additional 19 studies also supports the effectiveness of family planning counseling during maternal healthcare visits on postpartum modern contraception uptake. Conclusion: Integrating family planning counseling into maternal healthcare can significantly increase modern contraceptive use in the postpartum period, as such effectively reducing unintended and short interval pregnancy as well as adverse maternal and child health outcomes. Policymakers should prioritize training healthcare providers and developing standardized protocols for effective counseling."

We estimate the epidemiological impact of this SARS-CoV-2 lineage replacement in Brazil and we further assessed the cross-reactive neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients infected during 2023. We analyzed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 lineages and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases in Brazil between July 2023 and March 2024. We evaluated the cross-reactive NAb responses to the JN.1 variant in a cohort of convalescent Brazilian patients, both before and after infection with XBB.1* lineages. JN.1 replaced XBB with similar temporal dynamics across all country regions, though its epidemiological impact varied between locations. The Southeastern, Southern, and Central-Western regions experienced a brief XBB wave around October 2023, shortly before the introduction of JN.1, without any immediate upsurge of SARI cases during viral lineage replacement. By contrast, the Northeastern and Northern regions did not experience an XBB wave in the latter half of 2023 and displayed a rapid surge in SARI cases driven by the emergence of the JN.1. We found that recent XBB infections in the Brazilian population significantly boosted cross-reactive NAb levels against JN.1. The XBB wave observed in the second half of 2023 in some Brazilian states likely acted as a booster for population immunity, providing short-term protection against JN.1 infections and delaying the rise of SARI cases in certain regions of the country."

The gut microbiome enables protection against diverse pathogens and exhibits dysbiosis during infectious and autoimmune disease. Studies based in the United States and China have found that severe COVID-19 cases have altered gut microbiome composition when compared to mild COVID-19 cases. We present the first study to investigate the gut microbiome composition of COVID-19 cases in a population from Sub-Saharan Africa. Given the impact of geography and cultural traditions on microbiome composition, it is important to investigate the microbiome globally and not draw broad conclusions from homogenous populations. Results: We used stool samples in a Ugandan biobank collected from COVID-19 cases during 2020-2022. We profiled the gut microbiomes of 114 symptomatic individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 along with 76 household contacts who did not present any symptoms of COVID-19. The inclusion of healthy controls enables us to generate hypotheses about bacterial strains potentially related to susceptibility to COVID-19 disease, which is highly heterogeneous. Comparison of the COVID-19 patients and their household contacts revealed decreased alpha diversity and blooms of Enterococcus and Eggerthella in COVID-19 cases. Conclusions: Our study finds that the microbiome of COVID-19 individuals is more likely to be disrupted, as indicated by decreased diversity and increased pathobiont levels. This is either a consequence of the disease or may indicate that certain microbiome states increase susceptibility to COVID-19 disease. Our findings enable comparison with cohorts previously published in the Global North, as well as support new hypotheses about the interaction between the gut microbiome and SARS-CoV-2 infection."

However, manual SOFA calculation is time consuming. Thus, we developed an automated real-time SOFA score application that has been fully implemented into the major electronic health record (EHR) system (TakeCare) in Stockholm. We aimed to describe the method and evaluate its performance for detection of sepsis. Method: We developed an automated SOFA application that presents a total score (SOFATotal) over time and a baseline score (SOFAChronic) based on outpatient data prior to hospital admission. We evaluated its performance on 583 sepsis alert patients in an emergency department, including 472 with sepsis according to manually calculated SOFA (SOFAManual). SOFATotal at 30 minutes and 3 hours, and quick-SOFA (qSOFA) were compared with SOFAManual for detection of sepsis. The acute SOFA score (SOFAAcute) was calculated by subtracting SOFAChronic from SOFATotal. Results: SOFATotal at 3 hours showed moderate-good agreement with SOFAManual (R2 = 0.76). Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for sepsis detection were 0.83 at 30 minutes, 0.94 at 3 hours for SOFATotal, and 0.67 for qSOFA. Among patients with SOFAChronic [&ge;]1 (21% of cases), SOFATotal of [&ge;]2 was observed in 90% of cases (mortality 13.5%), although SOFAAcute of [&ge;]2 was noted in 63% (mortality 16.7%). Conclusion: The automated SOFA score demonstrated effectiveness in early sepsis detection, outperforming qSOFA, but adjustments for chronic baseline scores were necessary to avoid over-diagnosis. Further studies on broader patient populations would be useful to validate its clinical use."

""Vaccine efficacy"" describes a population-level effect measured in clinical trials, but mathematical models used to evaluate the impact of vaccination campaigns require specifying how vaccines fail at the individual level, which is often impossible to measure. Does 90% efficacy imply perfect protection in 90% of people and no protection in 10% (""all-or-nothing""), or that the per-exposure risk is reduced by 90% in all vaccinated individuals (""leaky""), or somewhere in between? Here we systematically investigate the role of vaccine failure mode in controlling ongoing epidemics. We find that the difference in population-level impact between all-or-nothing and leaky vaccines can be substantial when R0 is higher, vaccines efficacy is intermediate, and vaccines slow but can't curtail an outbreak. Comparing COVID-19 pandemic phases, we show times when model predictions would have been most sensitive to assumptions about vaccine failure mode. When determining the optimal risk group to prioritize for limited vaccines, we find that modeling a leaky vaccine as all-or-nothing (or vice versa) can change the recommended target group. Overall, we conclude that models of vaccination campaigns should include uncertainty about vaccine failure mode in their design and interpretation."

The pandemic revealed the utility of new data sources and highlighted challenges in interpreting surveillance indicators when changes in disease severity, testing practices or reporting occur. Aim: To estimate the trend in new COVID-19 infections by combining estimates of growth rates from all available surveillance indicators in Norway. Methods: We estimated growth rates from ten different surveillance indicators in Norway by using a negative binomial regression method and aligned the growth rates in time to hospital admissions by maximising correlations. Using a meta-analysis framework, we calculated overall growth rates and reproduction numbers, including assessments of the heterogeneity between indicators. Results: The estimated growth rates reached a maximum of 25% per day in March 2020, but afterwards they were between -10% and 10% per day. The correlations between the growth rates estimated from different indicators were between 0.5 and 1.0. Growth rates from indicators based on wastewater, panel and cohort data can give up to 14 days earlier signals of trends compared to hospital admissions, while indicators based on positive lab tests can give signals up to 7 days earlier. Conclusions: Combining estimates of growth rates from multiple surveillance indicators provides a good description of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. This is a powerful technique for a holistic understanding of the trends of new COVID-19 infections and the technique can easily be adapted to new data sources and situations."

There is a lack of decision modeling frameworks that can project cytomegalovirus (CMV) related patient outcomes and inform health policy. We created, tested, and calibrated a model of CMV acquisition and transmission in pregnancy using linked mother-infant dyads. Methods: We developed the Linking INfants and Mothers in Cytomegalovirus Simulation (LINCS) dyad-level Monte-Carlo microsimulation model of CMV infection among pregnant people and fetuses throughout pregnancy. We parameterized the model with data from the existing literature, implemented rigorous code testing procedures, and calibrated a key set of parameters to match model output to external data on cCMV prevalence and symptom risk. Results: A fully parameterized model for CMV among pregnant people and fetuses was developed, and the model code was confirmed to perform as specified. The calibration procedure identified parameter sets that generated model output closely matching the target values from the available data on cCMV prevalence and symptom risk. Conclusions: The LINCS model's ability to simulate the natural history of CMV infection during pregnancy was described and demonstrated, and the model was tested and calibrated to ensure proper functioning. Base case parameters were derived for CMV infection natural history to be used in future decision analyses of CMV testing and treatment strategies."

Chan School of Public Health']","Objective: Depressive symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors often co-occur. However, our understanding of the potential mechanisms and temporal dynamics underlying their co-development remains elusive. Method: This population-based cohort study examined bidirectional longitudinal associations between depressive symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors from age 10 to 25 years, using prospective data from the ALSPAC Study. Participants with at least one (of six) follow-up measurement for each outcome were included in the analyses. We measured depressive symptoms through self- as well as parent-reports, and assessed several cardio-metabolic risk factors (including adiposity measures, lipid profiles and inflammation). Results: Among our 7970 (47% male) participants, we found bidirectional, within-person associations between self-reported depressive symptoms and adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass index, but not body mass index), across the study period. Adiposity was more stable over time ({beta} [range] = 0.75 [0.54; 0.84]), compared to depressive symptoms (0.26 [0.12; 0.38]), and it had a stronger prospective (i.e., cross-lagged) association with future depressive symptoms (0.07 [0.03, 0.13]) compared to that between depressive symptom and future adiposity (0.04 [0.03, 0.06]). The magnitude of these associations reached its peak between 14 and 16 years. We did not find evidence of cross-lagged associations in either direction between depressive symptoms and waist circumference, insulin, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol or C-reactive protein. Conclusions: These findings suggest a bidirectional relationship between depressive symptoms and cardio-metabolic risk factors, particularly adiposity (i.e., fat/lean mass). Adiposity showed a stronger prospective association with future depressive symptoms, than vice versa, however their relationship revealed more reciprocal than previously thought."
